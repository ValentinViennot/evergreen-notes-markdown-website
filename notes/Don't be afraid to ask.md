Many times we would anticipate a negative answer and not ask.

"Oh but they're way out of my league", "why would they care", "it's not aligned with their goals" ... 

Same as [[Others are not in your mind]], you are not in their minds either.

What are the outcomes:
- Don't ask, don't know (and it was a yes)
- Don't ask, don't know (and it was a no)
- Ask, get a no
- Ask, get a yes

[[All winners played the game]]

The only way to know is to ask them. Don't be afraid to ask.

- [[Stop making excuses]]
