Excuses aren't bad per-say. But they hold you back.

It's important to explain why you failed (or rather, why you didn't succeed yet).

But it's even more important to move forward, learning from your mistakes.

When you present something that went wrong, don't stop at making excuses.
Explain the reasons why it may have gone wrong, **what you learned**, and how do you plan to move forward (or at least, clearly outline what are your options now).

Stop making excuses.
Or, said otherwise, **Don't stop at making excuses**.
