In economics, a network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the phenomenon by which the value or utility a user derives from a good or service depends on the number of users of compatible products. Network effects are typically positive feedback systems, resulting in users deriving more and more value from a product as more users join the same network. The adoption of a product by an additional user can be broken into two effects: an increase in the value to all other users (total effect) and also the enhancement of other non-users' motivation for using the product (marginal effect).  — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect)

A successful network effect relies on the validity of two hypothesis ([[The Lean Startup]]):

- The Acquisition Hypothesis
- The Retention Hypothesis

Similarly to [[Brand Equity]], the value of a network is positively related to the intention of participants to recruit more participants and those of existing participants to stay.
