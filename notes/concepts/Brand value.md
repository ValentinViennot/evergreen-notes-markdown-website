Brand Value is the financial value of a brand. It's what you should pay to acquire it.

There's no perfect way to estimate it, but quite logically it should reflect the difference of price between a product without brand and the same product with the Brand.

Another way to estimate Brand value is to **sum the amount of investment** (R&D cost) that went into building it ("Cost Approach", [[blog/posts/investing-time/index|Capital: Time, Money, Influence]]).

In order to protect Brands, Trademarks can be subscribed/purchased.

Brand Value is different from [[Brand Equity]], which measures consumer sentiment and awareness of a specific brand.
