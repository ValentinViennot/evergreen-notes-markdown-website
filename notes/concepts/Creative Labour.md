As opposed to [[Undifferentiated Labour]], Creative Labour is one that requires creativity.

Creative Labour cannot get commoditised.

Creative Labour cannot be simply replaced by mechanical machines.
Although, it is possible to envision in 2023 that Creative Labour will eventually also be executed by AI-enabled systems. Yet still, each new occurence is by-definition creative, therefore generating incompressible value.

Lawyer firms, true engineering and design acts, investigative or judgmental rulings, artistic performances, etc. are all examples of Creative Labour.
