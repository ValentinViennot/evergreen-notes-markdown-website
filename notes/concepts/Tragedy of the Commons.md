"The population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension in morality" — Garett Hardin.

The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory where individual people act in their own self-interest and deplete shared resources, even if it's detrimental to the group as a whole.

In other words, when a resource is scarce but free and there's no economic incentive for economic agents to either limit themselves or contribute to its development, agents will take as much as they can from it and eventually lead to its total destruction.
