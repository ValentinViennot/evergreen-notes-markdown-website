How likely are you to get to pitch in an elevator?

The point with this concept is to convince in very little time to anyone with short attention span (to give you) **that they want to hear more** about what you have to say.

An elevator pitch shouldn't focus on your idea.

An elevator pitch should focus on WHY DO I WANT TO HEAR MORE OF YOU?

- Setting the scene
	- Something your audience will agree with
	- A complication that creates tension
	- A resolution to that complication
- Your one sentence pitch that makes them want to hear more
- Some information for them to contact you/schedule time with you

(notice similarities to [[Pyramid Principle Writing]])

In fact, did you know that our company is wasting 100,000$ each year
because of unused but still-running cloud services?
I have built a script that can identify these and turn them off.
Do you want me to show it to you? 
We can meet after lunch break, I'll be next to your office.
