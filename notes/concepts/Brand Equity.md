Brand Equity is an Intangible. It's the perceived value of a [[Brand Value]] based on public sentiment. Yet, its financial market value and economical influence is real.

Brand Equity has some similarities to Stock trading —in fact the two often correlate:

- Market value
- Sentiment-based value
- Risk and reward-based returns

Extrapolating one of the common ways of measuring [[Brand Value]], Brand Equity could be defined as the **sum of the estimated future investments** that will go into building it.

A multilevel marketing (or, network marketing) approach is strong-leverage way to rapidly develop Brand Equity. While the approach might seem controversial and might not always be durable, it allows us to conclude the following: "Brand equity is positively related to the intention of customers to recruit new members", "Brand equity is positively related to the intention of customers to stay", (A. Chang, 2005).

Longer-term, Brand Equity is mostly a function of product quality. "Price-promotions have a negative impact on building brand equity while distribution intensity and the quality of products have a positive influence." "Advertising spending is not related to building brand equity." (H. Evanschitzky & D. Moritz Woisetschläger, 2007)
