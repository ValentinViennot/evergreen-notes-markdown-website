In [[The Lean Startup]], Eric Ries gives it the following unconventional definition:

"Any commercial structure organised by people with the objective of conceiving and building a new product or service under extreme uncertainty conditions."

This is a great definition to understand what _makes_ a Start-Up.

I used to think of Start-Ups using a more conventional definition (= starting up):
"A new venture with fast high growth potential ([[VC funding]])."

However, it isn't true and it fails to capture the unique _essence_ of Start-Ups.
