[[TODO]]

Write every day.

Others are not in your mind.
Write down your thoughts.
[[Building in public|And share them]].

Writing also helps to clarify your own thoughts.

Writing in the morning is good to uncover overnight insights.
Writing in the evening is good to empty and refocus your mind.
Do both?.
