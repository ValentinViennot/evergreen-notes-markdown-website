Venture Capitalists create funds for Limited Partners (LPs) to invest their money.

LPs provide the capital.
VCs generate profit.

VC investment is a very specific one.
They invest in [[Start-up]]s and ideas.
Their goal is not to invest in profitable companies, like other types of investments.
VCs' goal is to invest in the next billion-dollar companies ([[Unicorn]]s).
The reason of Why is that is well explained in the book [[How to be a Founder]]. 

Therefore, for [[Founder]]s, it is only a good idea to seek and accept [[VC funding]] if they are aiming to build a [[Unicorn]].
