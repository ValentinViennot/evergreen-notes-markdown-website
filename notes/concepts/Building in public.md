Inspired by other Founders and that [[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]] (and really, [[Open source should be the only way]]), I intend to start building more and more in public.

These notes ([[About_these_notes]]) are a first step towards this goal.
How more Open Source can you be than Open Sourcing the insides of your mind?

As part of [[EF W23 PA CORE]], I also intend to build as most as I can in public.
