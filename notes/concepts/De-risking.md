Investing, [Time, Money, or Influence](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/all-we-do-is-investment/) ([[blog/posts/investing-time/index|source]]), is an inherently risky activity.

The higher the risk, the bigger the potential reward ([[There's no big reward without taking big risks]]).

De-risking is not so much about reducing the inherent risk.
It's about reducing the effective risk.

It's all the things you can do in order to better [[Know what you don't know]].
And increase your chances of success.

In other words, it's to avoid taking stupid risks.
