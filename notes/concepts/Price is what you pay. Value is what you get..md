Warren Buffet [once said](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/price-what-you-pay-value-what-you-get) "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."

This quote raises interesting, deeper (with implications) questions:
- What is value?
- How to measure it?
- How to price?
- What happens if you don't price well?
- Are the financial markets efficient at pricing value?
- ...

[[Value is an abstract concept]] and [[Price is a consensus]] of its 'fair' [[Exchange Value]].
