Hey, I'm [Valentin](https://valentin.viennot.me.)!

After encountering [Andy's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), I decided to experiment with [[Evergreen notes]] and [[Building in public]]. I already deeply believed in the idea that [[Open source should be the only way]], and this only takes it a step further directly at the source of my thoughts.

These notes are [written for myself](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9). If you'd like to read essays and opinions written specifically for an audience, feel free to give [my blog](https://mindthegapblog.com/) a chance.

Good starting points to dive into my notes could be:
- [[What am I doing right now?]]
- [[Books and good reads]]
- [[The Open Market]] // [[TODO]]
- [[Learnings]] // [[TODO]]
- [[How to]] // [[TODO]]

[[Speak up]]. If you made it here and will be reading some of my notes, please do reach out with your thoughts: even (especially) if you think otherwise. The only requirement is to [[Be kind]]. You can reach out using my [email](mailto:valentin@viennot.me), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/valentinviennot/), [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentin-viennot/).

I'm new to this and would welcome all positive, encouraging messages in order to help me make writing become a consistent habit in [[My schedule]]. 

Although I don't spend much time coding these days, you can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/valentinviennot/), and that's where you'll find the [(open-)source code](https://github.com/unstaticlabs/evergreen-notes-markdown-website) for this website.
