If you have a crazy dream (really, a dream), you will navigate into big storms.

That's fine. [[There's no big reward without taking big risks]] ([[De-risking]]).

From the start, make sure to pick true believers.

They are the ones who will help you make the impossible happen ([[Don't let others dictate or shut off your dream]]).
