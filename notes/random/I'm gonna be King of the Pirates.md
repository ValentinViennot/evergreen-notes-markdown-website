Repeat it to yourself every day.
Say it out loud everywhere you go.
Tell it to everyone you meet.
Don't let others stop you.

Others are too busy with their own lives.
Most of them don't mean to stop you.
They just won't care.

But some of them WILL want to follow you.

Understand [[What's your dream?|what's their dream]] and convince them to share the journey.

Followership always starts with one.
