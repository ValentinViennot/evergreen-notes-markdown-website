["I'm gonna be king of the pirates!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flysqk6WfQE)

When you'll say your dream out loud, people won't believe you.

That's good. Because, they won't mind you.
But you are being honest.

And the few ones who do believe you: they are your crew.

Followership always starts with one.
If you believe hard enough, the right persons will follow your dream.
([[Ambition attracts Talent and Capital]]).

- [[Don't be afraid to dream out loud]]

- [[Don't let others dictate or shut off your dream]]

- [[Pirates aren't necessarily bad persons]]

- [[Empower your crew to reach their dreams]]

- [[As the Captain, you are responsible for the direction]]

- [[Only believers can make the impossible happen]]

- [[You can't guess the future, but you can make it]]
