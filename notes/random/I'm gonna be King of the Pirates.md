Followership always starts with one.
If you believe hard enough, the right persons will follow your dream.
([[Ambition attracts Talent and Capital]]).

- [[Don't be afraid to dream out loud]]

- [[Don't let others dictate or shut off your dream]]

- [[Pirates aren't necessarily bad persons]]

- [[Empower your crew to reach their dreams]]

- [[As the Captain, you are responsible for the direction]]

- [[Only believers can make the impossible happen]]

- [[You can't guess the future, but you can make it]]
