_"The Biggest Tech Company on Earth" presentation and roadmap_

**We're building the largest investment platform and fund for Open Source Software (OSS), turning open-source software into commodities to realign incentives.**

- Need for innovation: Innovation is really inefficient -> Slowing growth!
- Open source is the best way to innovate forward
- What is the problem today? : Realigning incentives (= Making it profitable)

Open source is everywhere - powering businesses, driving innovation. Yet, it's like a gold rush where everyone's mining, but no one is directly profiting. Incentives are misaligned. The tech sector is dominated by closed, secretive ecosystems, causing inefficiencies. Moreover, Europe lags behind the U.S. in the tech race, and we need a fresh approach. The French Government and European Commission are both betting on funding open source as a mean to recover their digital sovereignty. However, they are not in the right position to properly fund and incentivise open source projects and communities (tldr: lack of market).

We aim to bridge the old -current- economy with a new, "open market" one. Think of it as combining the best of capitalism and open source. By channeling financial and time investments into OSS, we not only champion freeing intellectual property and freeing workers but also unlock a revenue stream that's been untapped so far.

Our vision is a two-sided curation market: on one end, businesses invest in the future of open-source projects they rely on, and on the other, open-source contributors get funded and can freely work on solutions that have guaranteed interest and funding. It's about curating and creating value on both sides: assurance and problem-solving for businesses, and recognition and funding for contributors. It's Open Source Entrepreneurship.

Our business model of course profits from creating and running this new "open market" financial infrastructure (transaction fees, conversion rates, ...). But as we are aiming to eventually disrupt all tech with open source and open innovation, we must ensure a business model that mostly relies on creative, differentiated human labour. **Therefore, our business model is to become the first VC fund for disruptive open source software.**

1. **Open Market Infrastructure:** We're creating a financial system tailored to this new economy based on [Curation Markets](https://medium.com/@simondlr/introducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881) & [Continuous Organisations](https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepaper/) distributed tech.
2. **Culture:** We don’t just throw money at open source projects. On one hand, we create the economy that realigns consumers, contributors, projects, and investors incentives. On the other hand, we offer open source contributors —who are effectively the source of value creation— freedom, security, and purpose - aspects money can't always buy.  
3. **European Dream:** By championing open source, we aim to kickstart a tech revolution right here in Europe, positioning it as a global tech leader —open sourcing everything.

We’re not just aiming big; we’re methodically moving towards our goal. 

(First 3 to 6 months)
We plan to start where the biggest need and motivation currently is: efficiently connecting European governments and institutions to the open source projects they need to sustain and grow in order to recover their digital sovereignty. The market is already here but is waiting to get materialised by an independent 3rd party. Ad-hoc transactions are already happening between institutions and either projects, proxies/consultants, and individuals.

We have a pilot program currently in discussion with these institutions that could get started as a sandbox, gamified incentive platform that would operate as a proxy between institutions and open source projects and contributors (think, Tokenised GitHub Sponsors).

(First year)
The goal for the first year is to iterate on the platform as an invitation-only experiment, efficiently connecting consumers, contributors, and projects. Progressively adding consumers that are already streamlining money to open source foundations and projects today (or already are interested in influencing their future). We will partner with the open source fondations and projects, offering them a way to attract 10x more funding.

(First two years)
In two to three years, we will have opened the platform and made it an open source protocol under the responsibility of an independent Non-Profit Foundation. This will become the financial infrastructure of open source projects funding. We will operate the first Open Source Brand Equity Exchange of the Open Market Infrastructure. We will operate as an Investment Fund, regulated and fully-compliant entity. We will place funding from investors towards specific open source projects and contributors incentives.
We will develop the culture and strategy required to become the leading OSS VC.

(First 5 years)
Once established, we will leverage our effective position to become the one-stop-shop platform for all open source for businesses of the traditional economy. We will give them the assurance to use open source software. This will include security and maintenance guarantees and influence over future software development in order to solve specific valuable problems that they are encountering (through market incentives). We fund ourselves on recurring subscriptions from all open source consumers ('insurance model'), transaction fees, and on the return on investments from our own bets. We will credit back part of the subscriptions cost to our clients as tokens to invest on specific problems that they encounter. This way, we will gain unique insights into the valuable investments our fund should be making. Using this recurring revenue security, we will employ fund analysts, partners and open source contributors to freely work on projects they deem valuable, like entrepreneurs. We will give them job security in exchange for a percentage on the value they create. We expect that this will drastically increase the number of contributors. In addition, happy and freed workers are much more productive workers. At this point, we will be positioned to progressively disrupt and open all proprietary tech.

(in 10 years)
By then, we will have become -by definition- the biggest tech company on earth. As we would have replaced most proprietary software with open source solutions.
Software doesn't have to be the only market we disrupt. It's a convenient way to start because the world already is dependent on open source software.
But, conceptually, all intellectual property could be valued and incentivised the same way.
We don't know if everything can or should be open and free. But one specific market comes to mind for the 10 years vision: the pharmaceutical market. With COVID vaccines, market issues arose that were showing symptoms very similar to those observed in the open source market today. As such, freeing the pharmaceutical innovation would be our potential next next step. Promising a much more innovative and fair future.
