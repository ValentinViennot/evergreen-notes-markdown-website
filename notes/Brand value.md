Brand Value is intangible. It's a public perception and can be as volatile as a stock.
(In fact, it's often correlated)

There's no perfect way to estimate it, but quite logically it should reflect the difference of price between a product without brand and the same product with The Brand.

One way to estimate Brand value is to sum the amount of Investment that went into building it. ([[blog/posts/investing-time/index|Capital: Time, Money, Influence]]).

In order to protect Brands, Trademarks can be subscribed/purchased.
