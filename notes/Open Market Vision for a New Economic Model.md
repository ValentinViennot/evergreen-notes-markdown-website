Creating a sustainable funding mechanism for free creations, especially free software. It's not just about funding open source (free software) but revolutionising the dominant economic model, making it more equitable, valuing intellectual contribution, and creating a direct link between work and its value.

**Disrupt the economic system to shift capital towards value creators, connecting workers directly to the outcomes of their labor. Move from financial capital to intellectual capital and establish an innovation marketplace that aligns interests.**

## Open source in the current economy

   - At its origin, free software (then often referred to as "open-source") exists due to idealistic engineers producing high-value work without compensation.
   - Software like Linux and Kubernetes has dominated entire markets. Most economic entities now heavily rely on software, and by extension, open-source.
   - Socially, open source offers immense qualitative value. Economically, it struggles with direct profit generation, causing a systemic contradiction.

## Funding principles for open source

   - Intellectual property is free and embodies the created value.
   - The work behind it is also free, forming the source of that value.
   - Free, non-alienated workers are highly productive.

## Open market: a new economy

   - Create a parallel economic model highlighting the Brand Equity of open-source projects. This is based on an estimation of cumulative future investments (paid in Brand Equity) for these projects.
   - Direct open source consumer spending towards funding the growth of projects and addressing specific challenges, connecting consumers, contributors, and open source projects (crowdfunding).
   - Draw investments from the traditional financial system towards this new innovation marketplace.
   - The new free economy (open market) will establish a marketplace to effectively link consumers, contributors, projects, and investors in the free sector.
   - The startup is seen as a "two-sided market" platform bridging traditional economy and this new free economy. Acting as an open source incubator, a "Marxist Lean Startup Studio", it would connect consumer needs to the contributor market via the project (Brand Equity) market.

## Macro implications

   - While the broader system remains capitalist, within the innovation market, influence (Brand Equity) and time (contributor work) would be treated as equal investments. This shift could prompt the broader job market to adjust.
   - There's a genuine dependency on open source in the real economy, and the opportunity cost is high for not exploring this vision.
