## Fuck the VCs. Manifesto.


We stand at the crossroads of a digital revolution.

The path we choose now will shape the future of humanity.

Let us choose wisely, with foresight, empathy, and commitment to a world where technology serves a fair, sustainable future for all.


We all of us have the right to invest in and get returns from technology.


## Creating an equitable and sustainable future through open innovation.


We are Humans.

We are workers, peasants, and peoples of the world. We are entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, thinkers, builders, investors... We are socially conscious individuals. 

We are Utilitarians.

We believe in creating the greatest good for the greatest number, measuring success not just in profits, but in positive societal impact.

We are Libertarians.

We advocate for personal freedom and autonomy in the digital realm, championing the right to innovate and share without unnecessary constraints.

We are Socialists.

We support a collective approach to innovation, where resources and knowledge are shared for the common good.

We are Democrats.

We uphold the principles of democracy, encouraging active participation and equal representation in the innovation process.

We are Techno-Open-Optimists.

We empower transformative open technology to solve the most pressing challenges of our time. We only believe in the open, decentralised, and equitable kind of innovation.

We are Progressivists.

We are committed to continuous progress, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible to drive positive change. But we claim that growth is not progress.

We are Determined.


**Our mission is to free innovation.**
**Democratising access to technology and finance.**


### We are responsible techno-optimists, we are...

- **Human-centric progressivists:** We believe in progress, but not just any progress. Ours is a vision where human well-being, equity, and environmental sustainability form the core of technological advancements.

- **Democratic social technologists:** Technology should not be a tool for profit, but a means to empower communities, uphold democratic values, and foster social cohesion. Technology should erase inequalities, not increase them.

- **Ethical innovation advocates:** Every technological stride must be measured not just by its brilliance or profitability, but by its ethical implications and impact on society at large. We recognise our society's and planet's fragility and advocate for innovations that not only respect but actively heal our natural world and better our societies.

- **Inclusive visionaries:** Our future is one where diversity is not just accepted but celebrated, where every voice finds a place in shaping our shared destiny. We embrace all identities and leverage the strength of community in empowering them.

### We value openness, collaboration, freedom

- **Freedom:** Free workers. Free users. Free knowledge. Free innovation. Free markets.

- **Openness**: Open source. Open science. Open governance. Open communities.

- **Collaborative meritocracy**: Working together is more democratic than voting.

- **Decentralisation**: Nothing justifies centralisation where decentralisation is possible.

### We believe in...

- **Balanced techno-optimism:** Technology is a potential force for good, but its value lies in serving humanity, not overshadowing it. Our optimism is grounded in the potential of technology to enhance life without compromising human values.

- **Collective empowerment over individualism:** The best of innovation is reached not in isolation but in collaboration, where shared goals triumph over individual agendas.

- **Uncapped progress, capped growth:** Economic prosperity and technological advancements should not come at the expense of our planet or future generations.

### We oppose...

- **Blind market dogmatism:** Markets are tools, not worshipped deities. They should serve society, not dictate its course.

- **Unregulated tech monopolies:** Concentrated power in the hands of a few giants destroys innovation and equity.

- **Technology without conscience:** Innovation devoid of ethical consideration is a path to societal decay. Monetary value is nothing more than an exchange of human labor.

- **Environmental negligence:** Ignoring the ecological impact of technological progress is unacceptable. The only kind of abundance we can accept is one for all species.

### Redefining value creation through open innovation

We aim to redefine value creation.

We stand for an open, decentralised, collaborative economy.

We prioritise collective innovation and societal impact over private profits.

We are committed to build the future of work as collective and open innovation.

#### 1. Redefining the economic system

We do not believe in the current economic system anymore.

Our 'capitalist' economy has led to an undemocratic world dictated by finance and controlled by tech monopolies, at the expense of human values.

We are all turned serfs, sweating our dignity in exchange for digital dopamine shots.
We are trapped in a consumerist illusion, acting as powerless users or buyers.
We are passively watching our own extinction, made to believe we can't do anything.
We are ironically hoping for random technology-'geniuses' billionaires to save us.

"It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism."

Whether 'Capitalism' is the problem or not is irrelevant (are we still even in a capitalist economy anyway?). Our economic system is problematic and we must fix it now.

Human labor and intellectual contributions must urgently get valued beyond monetary measures.

As workers and consumers, we hold the power.
Money is worth nothing if we don't play by the established rules.

##### The meaning of life. Why do we work?

We work because we are humans.

We work in order to give meaning to our lives. We work in order to consciously, intentionally shape our surroundings. We work as a socially organised way to expand.

Individual motives might differ (search for meaning, mission, survival...),
but collectively, our work serves a society-level accomplishment.

We work in order to create value.

Value is a flowing abstract matter, it's an exchange of power.
Capital, on the other hand, is an accumulation of power.

Value creation is trading one good for another, money for service, wage for skilled time.
The amount of value created theoretically equal the underlying utility of the trade.

Utility is defined socially: through markets, political structures, communities.

We defend our human right to solely work for goals and missions we believe in.

##### Value vs Price

Value is what we want it to be.

Price, on the other hand, is what we pay in order to access this value.

In theory, free markets should ensure 'fair' prices. Meaning that,
1/ We all pay the same price for a same good or service.
2/ It's the optimal (ie, the lowest) price we could have paid.

As utilitarians, we aim for the Pareto optimum: an optimal equilibrium situation where better for one would mean worse for others.

We believe in free markets to find the Pareto optimum. Free markets imply that,
1/ Exchanges of value can happen freely (within the boundaries of human rights),
2/ Everyone can access and fully comprehend the market place,
3/ By design, no arbitrage (=winning without risk) is possible.

Freedom is required in order to efficiently, democratically value things.

We acknowledge that under constraint or influence, value is meaningless.
For value to be, we must be able to freely want it to be.

##### Money and False promises

Money is nothing more than the promise of an exchange of value.

Throughout our lives, we all unequally collect and capitalise 'valuables':
- Time
- Influence
- Material and immaterial property

Often, we perceive and want to access value in valuables that are not ours.
(Maybe to provide to our material needs, comfort, or belonging.)
In order to access or obtain said valuables, a trade has to happen.
Generally, trading valuables for valuables isn't convenient nor fair.

Money is a convenient proxy-valuable, one we can all price equally. A 'commodity'.

Money was created as a means to an end. Its end was value creation, or rather value exchange. It now is the most universal way to exchange value.

Unfortunately, too often, money has become the end itself.

We refuse to let money define collective value.

We won't shy in finding alternative ways to exchange our value.
We won't hesitate to refuse exchanging our value for money.

##### Growth is not progress

We oppose associating growth and progress.

While they are correlated, we reject any form of causality.
Progress can happen without growth and growth without progress.

Progress is moving forward towards a destination.

If this destination isn't an equitable and sustainable future through open innovation for all, then we don't want it at all. We claim the right to disagree and step off the journey.

We refuse ill-defined, generic, purpose-less growth.

Growth is an increase in size. But the size of what?

- GDP? The amount of money in circulation? For whom?
- Resources used? On a resource-limited planet?
- The number of species going extinct? What for?
- ...

Growth isn't inherently good or bad. Neither is progress.

We deserve better.

##### Degrowth and progress

We don't want to work more.
We don't want to consume more.
We don't want to have always more.

We want to innovate faster, and bigger.
We want to invest more into meaningful progress.
We want to explore ourselves, our planet, the universe.

We want to work less.
We want to consume less.
We want to have less, but better.

We want to live.
We want to love.
We want to laugh.

#### 2. The role of open innovation

The future of innovation will be open or won't be.

Open innovation is the only way to have healthy competition, that benefits us all.

Technology, techno-optimism, won't save us. Unless we join forces and cooperate.

Our generation is faced with immense, life-or-death challenges.
We blame it on the previous generations. We blame it on the system.
The only way forward is together. Collaboration, collectivism, cooperation.

For the sake of survival, we will ignore and disrespect the defenders of close innovation.

##### Individualism vs Collectivism

We are individuals. We live for ourselves, first.
We are communities. We live to belong to social groups.
We are humans. We live to care for others, and be cared for.

We believe in agency, in individualism. And yet we also believe in collectivism.

The accomplishments of the free software movement and open source communities out there are testaments to the power of collectivism. Despite the system.

We believe that humans are fundamentally good. Despite bad events.

We celebrate the uniqueness of each individual, their right to think, create, and innovate independently.
We recognise and avocate for the inherent power of personal freedom.
We think that the diversity of thought and experience that each individual brings is the foundation for meaningful and deep innovation.

We acknowledge the incredible potential of collective action, where shared goals and mutual support lead to greater achievements than any individual could accomplish alone.
We embrace the concept of community, understanding that togetherness is a source of strength and resilience.

We assert that the true essence of innovation lies in the harmony of both individual agency and collective effort.
We strive to create spaces where individuality is not lost in the collective, but rather, where it is celebrated and enabled to contribute to the greater good.
We believe in a world where individual aspirations and communal goals are not at odds but are used in synergies, driving us towards a more inclusive and sustainable future.

##### Competition vs Cooperation

Competition can be good; when it's a race that encourages everyone to run faster.
Competition can be bad; when the narrow focus on winning turn into fist fights.

Cooperation can be good; when pooling knowledge and resources for shared goals.
Cooperation can be bad; when it suppresses individual initiative.

We too believe in competition, because we too believe in evolution.
We too believe in evolution, because we too believe in life.
We too believe in the truth.

We too believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is better than scarce. We too believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and everything abundant.

Yet we believe cooperation is a whole part of evolution.
In fact, we don't believe that evolution means letting down the disadvantaged.

We believe in cooperation, because we believe it to be the reason why the human race evolved so far and so big. "Together we go further."

Our ability to cooperate, to suppress our primal instincts, is in fact our biggest strength.

#### 3. Empowerment through decentralised participation

"""
Let's push the emperors into the ocean
Don't need a goon to flirt with devotion
With every hour, our number increases
We'll smash your institutions to pieces

We need a transformation
One we all can see
We need a revolution
So long as we stay free

Welcome to the desecration, baby  
We'll build you right up and we'll tear you down
Welcome to the celebration, baby
The judges are jailed and the future is ours

Free your sons and unlock your daughters
We'll throw the baby out with the bathwater
With every second our anger increases
We're gonna smash your nation to pieces
"""

##### Curating identities

Our identities are who we are. Our identities belong to us.
Our identities are value.

Only us can curate our identities. Yet, platforms took it away from us; and corporate-exploited Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to go even further.

As knowledge isn’t scarce anymore, curated knowledge will be. But curated doesn’t mean much in a vacuum or outside of the human eye. Curated only means something because we are alive, conscious, social beasts. 'Curated' means identity.

Identity curation gives birth to communities. Communities forge identity and amplify value. Communities rightly blur the borders between work, life, and side projects.

We won't let AI curate our identities. We humans will organise. We will build communities, to defend our humanity.

We claim our humanity.

##### Resource allocation

The process of curation is the one of resources allocation: where is time, money, and influence being spent.

We believe resource allocation should be here to empower. Never to disable.
We believe the exercise of resource allocation should happen freely.

We claim that knowledge must be freely accessible to all, providing the foundation for informed autonomy and enabling the collective intelligence necessary to address systemic issues and develop collective ambition.

We claim the freedom for communities to self-organise, and that societal structures should facilitate serendipitous innovation and resilience, ensuring that every individual has the same opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the collective effort to solve our biggest problems and achieve their own mission.
