Innovation in 2023 is mostly coming from Start-ups and (Big) Corporations.

Research is of course an important field, but it's rarely packed directly as an innovation.
Research produces breakthroughs and advancements.
And then companies turn these into tangible innovations (products and services).

But then... 

- [[Corporations destroy value]]
- [[Entrepreneurship is random]]

On top of that, once one created enough profit, they get disproportionate power and leverage to decide innovation ([[The (Wrong) God-like Designer Theory of Innovation]]). 

TL,DR: The mainstream way of innovating is just plain wrong.
It's a giant waste of natural and human resources.
With no meaningful goals, no collective vision.

Hopefully I believe our way or working is already changing.
At least, in people's minds and dreams it is.
The only need is to enable it to change.
([[The changing way of working]], [[The Open Market Manifesto]]).
