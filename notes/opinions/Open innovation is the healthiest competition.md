Healthy competition is where businesses would compete with each other in a fair and transparent manner to provide the most value to society (as in, consumers).

We could summarise ideal competition as the following conditions:

- **Many competitors**: plenty of choice for the customer
- **Low barriers to entry**: high barriers limit competition and new options
- **Transparency**: clear, accurate information for consumers to make informed decisions
- **Fair rules**: avoid price-fixing and monopolies
- **Investment in innovation**: profit goes to funding newer, better solutions
- **Consumer choice**: switching between products should be easy
- **Consumer feedback**: opportunity to provide feedback and hold accountability
- **Consumer protection**: regulations and entities to enforce customer rights

(Note that the same rules would apply to any competition, including elections)

**Open (as opposed to closed source, closed doors) innovation does encourage all the conditions listed before**: low barriers to entry (reproducing is free), many forks and flavours, full transparency, no monopoly, no secrecy, (little) profit going back to contributors, customers have almost unlimited choice (including building their own), feedback happens in the open,...
