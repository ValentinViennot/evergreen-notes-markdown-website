**"Value" is an [[abstract concept]], deeply personal and subjective.**

> Could it be that _value_ as a concept, but also as an instance, is a [scissor concept](https://j.mirror.xyz/RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc)?

The value of something depends on what **you** see in it. What **you** imagine you could be doing with it. The sense of belonging, satisfaction it might give **you**. Sometimes more, you can perceive it through the lens of the cost savings (or additional profits) it'll enable **you**...

Orthogonally, the [[Price is a consensus]]. A trade agreement ([[Exchange Value]]).
(And sometimes, a generalised consensus ([[Market Exchange Value]])).

This consensus has to exist because 'value' isn't simply perceived by the receiver.
The seller (value creator or intermediary) also has an understanding of 'value'.

On the seller end there's a mix of:
- The subjective value for the seller
- The assumed value for their buyer

On the one hand they might have a sense of value for what they created or own (what did it cost them, what it represents to them, what they imagine they could do with it...).
On the other hand, they'll try to understand what it represents for you.
(Note that intermediaries (traders) are better at the latter and often don't care about the former.)

As long as you didn't exchange something, value is preserved.
Once you exchanged something, value is replaced with exchange value.
In an exchange, there can be winners and losers. Ideally, all should feel like winners.

The market should optimise the exchange value (for utilitarians ([[Utilitarianism]]), = finding the [[Pareto optimality]]).

In Economy, we often refer to two ways in order to 'create' value:
- [[Value creation and capture]]
- [[Value extraction (rent-seeking)]]

Personally, I do believe that [[Value cannot be created]], but that [[Value can be revealed]].
