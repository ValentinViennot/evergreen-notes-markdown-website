**Open Source will always be the cheapest most innovative most adaptable solution.**

Open Source is undeniably the most resource efficient way to build software.

Not because developers are not getting paid ([[Open Source should always be Free]]). In fact, even if they were getting paid a fair share, the $0 infinite replication cost would still make it the most efficient option for all.

Another reason is that [[Happy workers are better workers]].

The cost to entry (for a new competitor) being $0 , and the ability to fork and merge projects and accept external contributions being endless , Open Source solutions are more likely to be more innovative. Even if not, they would eventually catch-up on proprietary solutions (as seen with Stable Diffusion, GPT, and others).

Because anyone can use, modify, and share Open Source Software, it is —by default— the most adaptable solution available.
