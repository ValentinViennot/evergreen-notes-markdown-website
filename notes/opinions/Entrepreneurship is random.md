Many people have ideas and dream of being entrepreneurs.
([Your idea is Brillant, your idea is Worthless](https://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter-lesson-204-your-idea-is-brilliant-your-idea-is-worthless/))

Most of the time they won't even try because:
- it's never the right time (too much to lose)
- unjustified fears (eg. not having the right idea)
- justified fears (eg. lack of savings)

Therefore, it requires a specific profile to be a Founder.
([[How to be a Founder]])

Then, even the best Founders are likely to fail.
Even the best ideas, even with lots of funding.

Why? Because **Entrepreneurship is random**.

1. Success almost entirely depends on one or two **individuals**.
2. Bootstrapping a [[Start-up]] mostly happens in **isolation**.
3. Failure might come from random, unrelated **conditions**.

Often, it will take many separate attempts for an idea to exist.
Often, the best ideas won't win (or won't exist).
