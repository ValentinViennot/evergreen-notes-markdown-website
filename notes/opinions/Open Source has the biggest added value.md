If you define value as what society gets from an innovation.

Then Open Source has the biggest added value.

It's free and open to everyone, allowing many people to work together, create things faster, and customise solutions. It's also transparent, secure, and doesn't tie you to one company. Moreover, Open Source is a gift to Education.

Open Source helps society by providing accessible and adaptable technology.

Yet, [[Open Source is not profitable]].
