- The way we innovate today is wrong:
	- what is innovation
	- why do we innovate
	- what's our goal
	- who gets to decide
		- revenue -> profit/debt -> capital
	- inefficiencies in allocating capital
	- inefficiencies in using capital
		- anti-thesis of the Open Innovation
	- the theory of evolution , vs innovation (competition)
	- 

- What's our goal?
