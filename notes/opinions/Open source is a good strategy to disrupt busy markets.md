When targeting an already busy market, the barriers of entry can be quite high.

Especially in the tech industry ([[There's only one winner]]).

If you're not first on the market, and you do want to be a player.
Then here's a strategy for you:

1. Do exactly what your top competitor is doing,
2. Do it as well as them, maybe even better,
3. Open source everything.

Because it becomes basically free to do the same as your main competitor,
they are now in a very difficult position.

You might not be #1, but they aren't either.

In fact, if you play your cards right, this gives you an opportunity to create a new market, a new opportunity to compete (on something else) and become #1.
