Since 2020, we've seen the way of working evolve and revealing hidden pains.

Workers, especially younger and more educated, are looking for meaning in their labour.

They will prioritise meaning over higher paying jobs:

- Highly-skilled workers deciding to live a creative or entrepreneur life
- Community work and Open Source projects
- Remote work, allowing a balance of work and personal life, breaking away from the 9-to-5 routine
- Non-profit missions
