We mainly observe three business models for open-source projects:

1. **Close source mix**: Only some parts of the solution are open-source
2. **Extra services**: As the software experts, sell extra services
3. **Brand value**: Leverage brand value (~Trademark)

The first option is 'cheating' (it is not fully-truly Open Source).
The second option doesn't scale well (Red Hat was no exception).
The third option is hard to leverage, and is often combined with others.

In addition, there are indirect ways to leverage open source to create value:

4. **Market disruption**: [[Open source is a good strategy to disrupt busy markets]]
5. **Hybrid licenses**: Some newer Licenses are trying to conditionally mix full Open Source terms with Proprietary terms based on size/scale/revenue of the user.

The fourth option doesn't make any direct profit, but is a smart move.
The fifth option does seem fair, but arguably isn't true Open Source as [[Open Source should always be Free]].

Since the lack of funding for open-source projects is a real issue ([[Open Source is not profitable]]), we observe many more ways to leverage commercial open-source strategies in order to generate revenue from OSS. None of them are as scalable and profitable as Big Tech proprietary (or mixed) strategies.
