How can Open Source make money (in the 2023 economy):

1. **Close source**: Only some parts of the solution are open source
2. **Extra services**: As the software experts, sell extra services
3. **Brand value**: Leverage brand value (Trademark)

The first option is cheating (it is not true Open Source).
The second option doesn't scale (Red Hat was no exception).
The third option is hard to leverage.

I would add two more options to the list:

4. **Market disruption**: [[Open source is a good strategy to disrupt busy markets]]
5. **Hybrid licenses**: Some newer Licenses are trying to conditionally mix full Open Source terms with Proprietary terms based on size/scale/revenue of the user.

The fourth option doesn't make any direct profit, but is a smart move.
The fifth option does seem fair, but I wouldn't consider it true Open Source because [[Open Source should always be Free]].
