Corporations must make profit.

Their one and only goal (as defined in the US at least) is to be the most profitable.

They will cut costs, optimise resource use, and do strategic interested innovation.

Good then, no?

No.

Because they do it all wrong.

Many thesis tried to improve this situation: [[The Lean Startup]], [[Inspired]], and others.
And things did get a little better.
Yet still, as most of companies get bigger they become processes factories unable to innovate. They will waste a lot of resources on useless innovation efforts.

The costs savings coming from centralised organisation does not compensate the opportunity cost of building in private ([[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]]).

Because of market positions, marketing, or (quasi)monopolies ([[The winner takes it all]]), typical organisations are able to sell and promote products and services that are not the best option.

In the end, current markets are only able to identify local optimums â€”but not maximum value.

Eventually, both consumers (including users) and workers suffer from this situation ([[The changing way of working]]).

Should we aim for [[Open Organisations]]?
