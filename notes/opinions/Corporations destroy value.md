Corporations must make profit.

Their one and only goal (as defined in the US at least) is to be the most profitable.

They will cut costs, optimise resource use, and do strategic interested innovation.

Good then, no?

No.

Because they do it all wrong.
After [[The Lean Startup]], [[Inspired]], and others, things got a little better.
Still, as most of companies get bigger they become processes factories unable to innovate. They will waste a lot of resources on useless innovation efforts.

Because of market positions, marketing, or (quasi)monopolies ([[There's only one winner]])
