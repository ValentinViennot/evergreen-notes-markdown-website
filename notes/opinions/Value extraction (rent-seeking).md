Value extraction usually happens with platforms (or lands).

In a situation, an economic agent owns a platform (the landlord).

They will charge any other economic agent operating [[Value creation and capture]] on their platform.

Effectively, this happens with monopolies, locking and overcharging their 'customers'.

Interestingly, since digitalisation, this became the goal ([[Zero to One]]) of many [[Founder]]s.

This doesn't [have to](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2021/05/02/why-business-must-shift-from-value-extraction-to-value-creation/) (nor [should](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market)?) be the case.

'Reasonable' value extraction can happen, charging a 'fair' price for the use of property
([In this report, the IMF discusses the concept of 'fair value'](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Data/Statistics/BPM6/FITT/f9-valuation-of-loans-fair-value.ashx)).

However, the definition of 'fair' being subjective ([[Value is an abstract concept]]), such situation would require a [free market](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Free_market) with sufficient offer and demand, and **competition**. In addition, it also requires the agents not to agree and to be informed and [educated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) and [unbiased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJO5GstqTSY). Only then, a theoretical [[Pareto optimality]] can be achieved (provided that you agree it's desirableâ€”[[Utilitarianism]]).
