[[Open Source should always be Free]]

As the statement implies, Open Source can't make a direct profit.

Of course, there are ways to make side profits with Open Source:
[[The Open Source business models]].

However, as described in the linked Note, they all have downsides.

Most of the time the `Selling price - Cost of build = Added value` equation will give a very low (if not 0) Added Value, then translating to no or hard profitability.

In conclusion, Open Source has no added value.

Considering [[Open Source has the biggest added value]], my second conclusion is that the market is broken (= not properly doing its valuation job to serve us).
