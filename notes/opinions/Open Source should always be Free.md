By definition, Open Source is free.

It's free as in free-dom (libre).
And, as a required consequence, it's free as in beer (no cost).

A true Open Source License lets you:

1. **Use** the software or artefact for any purpose.
2. **See** the source to understand how it works.
3. **Change** the source (code) to fit your needs.
4. **Share** the source or artefact with others.
5. **Distribute** your changed versions to others.

It should not stop you from doing these things or require you to pay for them. It's all about freedom to **use**, **modify**, and **share** (the source).
