In tech industries, one can observe there is usually only one winner.

More specifically, it's often like this:

1. First player gets 80% of the market share
2. Second player tries to catch-up and gets <20% share
3. Third player gets some niche users...

There are many examples of this:
- Smartphones
- Compute clouds
- Social networks (per segment)
- Search engines

One of the reasons might be the unrestricted addressable market of tech solutions.
Network effects also play a big role. The fact that profits are mostly investments (because of the low-to-zero reproduction cost) and that [[At the end of a Monopoly game, there can only be one winner]].

Then, [[Open source is a good strategy to disrupt busy markets]].
Take example on Google with Android and then Kubernetes.
