In a Capitalist Economy.
([[Capitalism]])

Let's say everyone is born equal, with an equivalent pre-defined amount of capital.
([[blog/posts/investing-time/index|Capital is Time, Money, and Influence]])

One smart Entrepreneur builds a value-creating product and become highly successful. They gather enough capital from a few Investors (individuals). They employ other individuals as wage workers.

Over time the Entrepreneur is more and more successful.

The Investors (including the Entrepreneur) get potentially unlimited profits.
In the meantime, wage workers get their fixed compensation.

Things of life (in particular public services) become more expensive ([[Cost Disease Theory]]). As a result, the Investors become relatively even richer.

They now have more of the initially evenly distributed capital.
([[At the end of a Monopoly game, there can only be one winner]])

Because Investment power is proportionate to Capital, they get more.
But they also get more authority. Over ever more employees (workers).

As a consequence, a few of the richest become "God-like" designers.
And start making arbitrary decisions unjustified and unmoderated by the market.
