AI-powered systems are starting to generate [[Creative Labour]]. Yet, their nature makes them likely to quickly get commoditised (the use of the AI models , not their output).

It might mean that many so-far-human-only arts/crafts will eventually get disrupted by AI and that AIs will eventually compete with Humans and make our labour less valuable.

Our society will need to adapt and regulate these new technologies not just as "another" technology. They raise concerns and questions that differ in their nature.

If we don't make clear conscious human decisions today, choosing an AI over a human for [[Creative Labour]]-type of works **will** happen for cost motives. Additionally, their output might very soon become at least as good, if not better, than those of humans.

At this point, we need to remember Why we work. Beyond the economic system and the profit motives, Humans work to give meaning to their lives and shape their world.

AI will have the ability to do that for us.

The question is not whether they will be capable of doing it.
The question is whether -as humans- we want that to happen.

And we can't let our economic system choose for us.

We need conscious human decisions now.
