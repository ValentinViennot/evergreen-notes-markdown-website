You won't go very far alone ([[Alone we go faster, together we go further]]).

You NEED others. And others somewhat need YOU.

But never forget that each one of them have their own dream(s).

Understand what their dreams are. Don't try to change their dreams.

A good Captain empowers others to fulfil their dreams, adjusting the navigation course so that, in the end, everyone wins.
