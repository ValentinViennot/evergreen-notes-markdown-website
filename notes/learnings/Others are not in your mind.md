Something you need to repeat yourself everyday: No one is in one else's mind.

You might have a very clear vision, very justified and certainly making sense in your view of the world.

Others don't have the same view of the world.
Others don't have the full picture unless you clearly paint it.

Same as taking a picture is not objective (you chose the frame, the angle, the light etc), painting a vision isn't either. And unfortunately you won't ever be able to 100% represent the vision you have in mind to others.

[[Seek to understand]]. [[Be kind]].

**You need** others to understand at least a part clearly so that they can help you.
