Why would Pirates be bad persons?

When someone says something like "it's impossible", ask why?

Keep asking Why until you uncover fundamental truths ([[First Principles]]).
If you don't hit a first principle (like, Gravity), then you still know better than them ([[Science is not about finding the truth, it's about knowing what we don't know]]).

People don't want change. It's a human instinct, a bias.
10 years ago, no one would have been able to describe the world as it is today.

You have the right to dream. But others won't make it easy for you.
It's not their job. It's your dream.
