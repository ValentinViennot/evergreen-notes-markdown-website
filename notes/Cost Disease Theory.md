Imagine the situation in [[The (Wrong) God-like Designer Theory of Innovation]].

Some get potentially unlimited/uncapped profits, while others get a fixed wage.

**[[TODO]]: Demonstration**

- Inflation and salary increases are disconnected
	- The more disconnected (in speed)
		- The most inequalities transform in 
			- fastest inflation for specific costs centres
- Are inequalities increasing or decreasing?
	- Not that simple
		- https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/picture.htm
	- BUT
		- Quality of life is generally increasing.
		- However is Capital power becoming more or less distributed?
			- More and more on Debt:
				- https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2017/10/03/rising-household-debt-what-it-means-for-growth-and-stability
			- People are growing their debt, earlier in their lives
				- And then repaying their right to live
	- ==> as long as economy is fine (ie, no crisis)
		- quality of life can increase "thanks to debt"
			- however, this is limited
				- if crisis, then inequalities would greatly increase
					- states would get more debt to blur the lines
						- and support people

Things of life become more expensive.
