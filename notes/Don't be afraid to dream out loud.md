What would the child in you want for the future you?

Dreams are crazy and sometimes irrational. There's nothing wrong with that.
Envision yourself in 5, 10, 15 years ([[Looking 5 years ahead]], [[Looking 10 years ahead]]).

You have the right to dream. Even if it's unrealistic.

Use this as your vision, your navigation course.

To help your dream become more concrete, say it out loud.
To yourself first, then to others, and then to everyone.
