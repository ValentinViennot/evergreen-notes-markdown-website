(top idea)  
Don't ask your mom (or truly anyone) if your idea is good.  
  
(the mom test) DON'T MENTION YOUR IDEA  
  
CUSTOMER DISCOVERY/PROBLEM  
ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS  
- Don't talk about your idea too early  
- Don't zoom in too early  
- Keep it casual  
  
Ask questions about what could kill your start-up. Understand customers. Ask open questions. Validate assumptions, not ideas.  
Investigate behaviours and beliefs.  
Ask questions THEY CAN'T lie to you about.  
  
1. Talk about their life instead of your idea.  
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generic or hypothetical in the future.  
3. Talk less and listen more. Take notes.  
  
Every customer conversation is bad by default.  
It's your job to make it good.  
IT'S YOUR JOB TO VALIDATE YOUR IDEA.  
Only the market can prove/validate it.  
  
Asking expert's opinions on an idea can be useful. But for users focus on what they are doing, and why + validate assumptions.  
  
Opinions are useless.  
  
"What would you dream product do?": Only good with the right follow up questions.  
--> Useful to get started the conversations  
--> Value comes from understanding Why  
  
No fucking committee  

Good questions  
- Sounds painful. Why do you bother?  
- What are the implications of that? How much does that matter?  

Watch someone do a task  

If they haven't found alternative solutions already, would they pay for yours?  
  
People stop lying when you ask them for money  
Ask them about their life: how much does this problem/workaround cost them?  
  
B2B: where does the money come from  
(+ who are the decision makers)  
  
If they really want to solve a problem and you're in a leaning mode, they will disclose their financials  
  
Who else should I talk to?  
(If no answer: either you're screwing something up or they don't care about the problem)  
  
People want to help you. Give them an excuse to do so.
--> Ask: Is there anything I should have asked you?  
  
You are not allowed to tell a customer what their problem is.  
They are not allowed to tell you what the solution should be.  
  
AVOID BAD DATA  
  
Compliments, opinions/hypothetical, feature requests/ideas.  
  
Most opinions don't matter. You want facts.  
  
Don't believe people who say they love it.  
  
Notice compliments and ignore/deflect it.  
Keep the meeting about them. Ask concrete questions. THEY ARE THE EXPERTS.  
  
Ask for permissions if you want them to try the product. Don't make it be a sales meeting: you are learning!  
  
YOUR GOAL IS TO FIND THE TRUTH, NOT CONVINCE. It's ok to miss and give time back.  
  
People want to feel like they had good meetings.  
  
Fluffs  
- usually/never/always  
- future tense: would/will  
- hypothetical: could  
---> specifics in the past  
---> step by step  
---> why this and not something else  
  
People are always willing to pay in the imaginary future... "I would definitely buy that"  
  
You want concrete specific and hard truth.  
--> Anchor in reality.  
  
Be specific and ask edge cases.  
  
Push people to make a decision to prove their point. , Prove it's worth for them.  
You want customers not complainers.  
  
Feature ideas: write them down but understand WHY they would want that and how they would use it exactly concretely.  
--> Understand Why before building.  
  
Startups must focus on ONE scalable idea.  
  
Dig around their ideas or emotions. Figure out WHY things.  
  
Don't mind being annoying, stay polite and ask for permission, give them excuses to talk.  
  
If you're switching to pitch mode: cut yourself off and apologize  
  
Imagine what you would like someone else to do/ask for you , and do it.  
  
Embrace bad news. Iterate on them.  
  
Don't zoom in too early. Ask generic questions and make sure your diving deeper into the right things.  
  
Product risk vs Market risk. Usually one bigger than the other depending on business.  
  
Prepare questions you want answered ahead. You need a list of your big three questions.  
  
Separate Problem/Solution/Sales conversations. Long meetings are best.  
It can be hard to get: Problem discovery doesn't have to be actual meetings.  
  
Keep it casual.  
It's a chat, not a meeting.  
It can happen anywhere anytime.  
  
PROTOYPING/SOLUTIONNING  
ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO BE HONEST.  
  
You are not trying to convince everyone of what you're doing , but to find who cares.  
  
Give customers clear options to say they're not interested. Avoid Zombie leads.  
  
Every meeting either succeeds or fail.  
Don't get friend zoned or zombied.  
  
Commitment = sale advancement.  
--> Successful meetings end with the customer giving you something of value to them. (Eg an introduction costing reputation, money, etc).  
  
Avoid non-committal meeting endings.  
  
It's your job to get a commitment. Ask for it.  
Commitment can be:  
- Cash (could also be Pre-order / Reservations)  
- Time (get them to commit concrete time to spend using/trialing/learning your product)  
- Reputation (Influence) (eg public testimonial or case study, introductions, public pilot product)  
(Has to be something they'll hesitate to give you)  
  
Get a compliment? Ask for commitment.  
  
To be non pushy, look excited and ask for concrete things. Understand exactly.  
  
Know what are your next steps and what commitments you want.  
  
Increase the cost of commitment. You can do that with trials adding friction during early stages. You want to figure if people REALLY want to be customers.  
  
In (big) companies , introductions and even free trials are very costly.  
  
Don't hard pitch: it gives binary feedback.  
(It's okay once bug business only)  
You're still learning!  
  
You're looking for early evangelists.  
(VV: That's goal for Unstatic Labs, starting here)  
--> ready to commit cash for a prototype and/or fight their boss  
--> Keep them close, precious allies.  
  
Early revenue is a side effect, goal is leaning.  
  
Cold calls are a transition to get introductions. Avoid and only do if necessary. People WILL ignore you. Rejection rate is irrelevant.  
YOU ONLY NEED ONE.  
  
People love talking about themselves and their problems.  
  
Goal of landing page is to find interesting/Ed people , not about metrics.  
  
Organise your own events is a great tactic to meet the right industry people.  
Teaching is also a great one (educational workshops).  
Industry blogging is also pretty efficient.  
--> Start blogging today, it takes time to create an audience but is incredibly useful.  
  
Again, not about metrics but about credibility and meeting the right people.  
  
Blogging is also great to refine your thoughts.  
  
Warm introductions is the most powerful tool.  
--> Advisors are useful to intros.  
  
When you reach out:  
1. Vision: what are you aiming to solve  
2. Framing: not a sales meeting , why were here  
3. Weakness: reveal you need help  
4. Piédestal: why are they amazing in particular  
5. Ask them to help you: explicit  
  
  
Prepare conversations  
- Top 3 questions to answer (not things you could be googling, do your homework): prepare with the entire team  
- Who is your target customer  
- Préparer assumptions and hypothesis about what customers will answer  
- Use in-person time to dive deep  
- --> Focus on the verbatims and observations from the customer conversations when communicating with the team, not conclusions --> draw conclusions together (at the beginning can be once per week, all team members are sharing all together) : key quotes tagged up with emotions  
  
Notes are useless if not read and not shared with your team.  
  
Weekly prep and feedback meetings with team  
  
  
GO BUILD YOUR COMPANY.  
DO YOU. DO YOUR BEST.
