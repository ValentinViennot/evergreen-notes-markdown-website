From [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom)'s work, here are the principles to successfully govern and regulate access to the Commons in order to avoid the [[Tragedy of the Commons]].

These involve setting clear rules, involving the community in decision-making, monitoring and enforcing those rules, and providing mechanisms for conflict resolution, all tailored to the specific resource and context.

1. **Clearly Defined Boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries that define who the members of the user group are and what the physical boundaries of the common pool resource (CPR) are. This helps in identifying the community responsible for resource management.

2. **Congruence Between Rules and Local Conditions**: Appropriation and provision rules, which specify how the resource can be used and how contributions are made, should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the resource and the local context.

3. **Collective-Choice Arrangements**: Allow all affected individuals to participate in making decisions about the appropriation and provision rules. This inclusivity ensures that those directly impacted have a say in the management of the resource.

4. **Monitoring and Enforcement**: Either the appropriators themselves or individuals accountable to them should monitor compliance with the established rules. Effective monitoring helps deter rule violations.

5. **Graduated Sanctions**: Sanctions for rule violations should be graduated, meaning they should be proportional to the severity, frequency, and context of the violation. This helps maintain fairness and discourage rule-breaking.

6. **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: Establish low-cost and readily available conflict-resolution mechanisms to mediate conflicts among appropriators and between appropriators and officials. This helps resolve disputes without resorting to costly litigation.

7. **Recognition of User Rights**: Ensure that users have recognition of their own rights to organise and manage the institutions governing the common pool resource. This recognition empowers the community to take ownership of the resource.

8. **Nested Enterprises**: For common pool resources within larger resource systems and political jurisdictions, establish nested enterprises with sets of rules. These rules should be created within a hierarchy of appropriator institutions, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.
