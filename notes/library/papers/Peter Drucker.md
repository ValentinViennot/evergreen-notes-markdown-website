- [Decentralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization "Decentralization") and simplification.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-30) Drucker discounted the [command and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_(management) "Command and control (management)") model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to [produce too many products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overproduction "Overproduction"), hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be [outsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing "Outsourcing")), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
- The prediction of the decline and marginalization of the "[blue collar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_collar "Blue collar")" worker.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-31)
- The concept of what eventually came to be known as "[outsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing "Outsourcing")".[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-32) He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: a company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its [core business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_business "Core business"). Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
- The importance of the nonprofit sector,[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-33) which he calls the third sector (the private and government sectors being the first two). Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
- A profound skepticism of [macroeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomic "Macroeconomic") theory.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-34) Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
- A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is [price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price "Price"). Drucker noted that microeconomics fails to show what products actually do for us,[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-35) thereby stimulating commercial interest in how to calculate what products actually do for us from their price.
- Economic chain costing: the idea that a competitive company needs to know the costs of its entire economic chain, not simply the costs for which it is responsible as an individual business within that chain. "What matters ... is the economic reality, the costs of the entire [production] process, regardless of who owns what."[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-36)
- [Respect for the worker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skills_management "Skills management"): Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and to give them freedom to do so.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-37)
- A belief in what he called "the sickness of government". Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government",[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-38) in his book _The Age of Discontinuity_, formed the basis of [New Public Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Public_Management "New Public Management"),[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-39) a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
- The need for "planned [abandonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonment_(legal) "Abandonment (legal)")". Businesses and governments have a [natural human tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost "Sunk cost") to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-40)
- A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
- The [need for community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_community "Sense of community"). Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community",[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-41) where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-42)
- The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-44) This concept of [management by objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives "Management by objectives") and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark _The Practice of Management_.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-45)
- A company's primary responsibility is to [serve its customers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service "Customer service"). [Profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting) "Profit (accounting)") is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and [sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability "Sustainability").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-46)
- A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among mankind's noblest inventions.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-47)
- "Do what you do best and outsource the rest" is a business tagline first "coined and developed"[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-48) in the 1990s by Drucker.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-49) The slogan was used primarily to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled "Sell the Mailroom."[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#cite_note-50)
