I love solving problems!

That's my passion. [[I've always wanted to be an inventor]].

Something newer, is that I understood I could not solve all the problems all by myself.

Therefore I have to be a good problem solver.

But, even more important, I need to be an excellent Team Builder.

I must be able to build passionate, dedicated teams of believers: thinkers and doers.

That's how I will be able to solve all the problems I want to solve.
