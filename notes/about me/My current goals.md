_Last update: September 19th, 2023_

I adopted the framework of [[OKRs]] for my personal goals.

This isn't about tracking metrics or having a formal process.
This is about looking further ahead and [[Keep your head up and look forward]].

I observed that with clear objectives in mind, no matter if I formally achieved them according to "metrics", I will tend to take actions and steps in the right direction.
In fact, the exercise of regularly setting and reviewing goals is about identifying and clearly stating what I believe to be the right direction.

I am guided by [[My mission]] and [[My values]]. As explained in my blog [Dying isn't as bad as not living](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/we-all-have-a-mission/) ([[blog/posts/we-all-have-a-mission/index|source]]), I want to make sure that I am indeed living.

Another, important part of setting goals is to schedule regular time to look back, evaluate and understand what happened, and re-assess. The retrospective is probably the most overlooked part of setting goals. ([[Retrospectives]], [[Experiment, Evaluate, Adjust, Repeat]])
