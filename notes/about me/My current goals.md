_Regularly-updated Note. Last update: September 12th, 2023_

I adopted the framework of [[OKRs]] for my personal goals.

This isn't about tracking metrics or having a formal process.
This is about looking further ahead and [[Keep your head up and look forward]].

I observed that with clear objectives in mind, no matter if I formally achieved them according to "metrics", I will tend to take actions and steps in the right direction.
In fact, the exercise of regularly setting and reviewing goals is about identifying and clearly stating what I believe to be the right direction.

I am guided by [[My mission]] and [[My values]]. As explained in my blog [Dying isn't as bad as not living](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/we-all-have-a-mission/) ([[blog/posts/we-all-have-a-mission/index|source]]), I want to make sure that I am indeed living.

Another, important part of setting goals is to schedule regular time to look back, evaluate and understand what happened, and re-assess.
This retrospective part is probably the most overlooked part of setting goals.

### Objective 1: Personal Growth

[[ENTP development guide]]

**Become the best version of myself. Prove to be a healthy self-aware ENTP with empathy, agency, good follow-through, and productivity.**

**KR1: Balanced cognitive development**

If I have successfully achieved balanced cognitive development as an ENTP, I should be able to measure or see that I can seamlessly integrate strategic thinking, meticulous attention to detail, and emotional self-awareness into my daily life, enhancing my problem-solving abilities.

  - **KR1.1:** Maintain a journal of strategic thinking exercises, including scenario planning and long-term goal setting, with at least 2 hours dedicated per week.

  - **KR1.2:** Maintain a reading log summarising two books per month. Engage in debates with others to discuss learnings and challenge personal beliefs, writing takeaways and reflections.

  - **KR1.3:** Create a schedule (using the [[Gauges]] app) of mundane attention-to-detail tasks paired with podcast listening, tracking their completion and time spent on each task.

  - **KR1.4:** Regularly recall significant past events in detail, noting sensory elements (sound, sight, smell, touch, and taste). Write down monthly retrospective logs focused on feelings.

**KR2: Enhanced follow-through, productivity, and focus**

If I have successfully improved my follow-through, productivity, and ability to focus, I should be able to measure or see that I consistently complete tasks and projects with a well-defined methodology, fostering tangible achievements.

  - **KR2.1:** Maintain a log of [[Pomodoro]] sessions (eg. using [[Google Calendar]] + [[Forest]]).

  - **KR2.2:** Build a habit of maintaining a To-do list each evening before bedtime, and going through it during the day. Especially in the morning.

  - **KR2.3:** Track the duration and frequency of minimum 3-hour focused work blocks with phone and internet on airplane mode. Achieve 5 per week.

  - **KR2.4:** Write every day. Adopt [[Evergreen notes]] and dedicate 30mn-1h daily.

**KR3: Prioritisation of well-being, mindfulness, and fitness goals**

If I have successfully prioritised well-being and physical fitness, I should be able to measure or see that I have reached specific body targets and established healthy daily routines.

  - **KR3.1:** Maintain a gym attendance log, noting dates, session durations (>45 minutes), with an average of five times per week ([[JEFIT]]).

  - **KR3.2:** Regularly monitor weight, recording measurements in a weight log, and maintain a target body weight of 70kg or higher (smart body scale).

  - **KR3.3:** Monitor body fat percentage monthly using a body composition scale, with the goal of achieving 12% or lower (smart body scale).

  - **KR3.4:** Maintain a morning routine, including regular wake-up time (<8am) and starting with a challenging task from the To-do list (see [[My schedule]]).

## Objective 2: EF Venture

**Launch my [[EF]] start-up, aligned with [[My mission]] of enhancing collective human intelligence while ensuring my happiness and that of others around me, and [[My values]].**

Success Looks Like: a funded EF venture that not only achieves its business goals but also makes a meaningful contribution to the improvement of human intelligence. It involves selecting the right co-founder, creating a product that aligns with my mission and values, and building a solid foundation for long-term success.

1. **Strategic vision and mission alignment**
2. **Team building and co-founder selection**
3. **Product development and market fit**
