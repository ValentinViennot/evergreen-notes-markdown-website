What is my fundamental Principle?

> Tl,Dr: The Principle of Equitable Empowerment is about making sure everyone has the same chance to learn, make their own decisions, and work with others to fix big issues. It's important that all people can get the information they need without any barriers. This helps everyone make smart choices on their own and work better together. People should be able to organise their own groups and communities the way they think is best. The way we set up society should help people come up with new ideas easily and be strong enough to handle tough times. By doing this, we make sure that each person can play their part and also gain from working together to meet the challenges we all face.

After watching [[Inventing on Principle]] and relating with what was being said,
I thought I should aim to find out and clearly state what my founding principle is.

I initially drafted, "systems where individuals and communities are equipped with the knowledge and autonomy to self-organise and collaboratively solve complex problems". But this isn't much actionable.

_“a principle gives you a new way to see the world— it divides the world into right and wrong in a fairly objective way”_

Therefore, looking at controversial or non-obvious situations and understanding the motivations leading to seeing them as right or wrong should help me formulate it.

- [[My mission]] leads me to go somewhere (why)
- [[My values]] guide me on how to get there (how)
- [[My principle]] tells me what to build? (what)

Let's list a set of unusual beliefs I have and try to explain why they are.

- Religion is the symptom of systemic injustice
- Knowledge should be free
- Collective intelligence overcome individual intelligence
- We're born equal, Education is the mother of all good and bad
- Systemic issues deserve systemic solutions
- Communities should be able to self-organise
- Love doesn't exist: it's the blend of many emotions

This relates with philosophical concepts and movements, such as

- The Multitude
- Serendipity
- Ubuntu
- Communitarianism
- Anarchism
- Open-Source Movement
- Utilitarianism
- Stoicism
- Hyperstructures
- Panarchy
- Democratic-Socialism
- Technoliberalism
- Marxist-Libertarian
- Stigmergy

**Everyone should have the same chance to access knowledge, make their own choices, and work together to solve big problems.**

Eventually, this is the phrasing I would use to describe my principle:

## Principle of equitable empowerment

Knowledge must be freely accessible to all, providing the foundation for informed autonomy and enabling the collective intelligence necessary to address systemic issues. Communities must have the freedom to self-organise, and societal structures should facilitate serendipitous innovation and resilience, ensuring that every individual has the same opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the collective effort to solve our biggest problems. Societal structures should be here to empower, not disable.
