This isn't exactly a joke.

Non-french-speaking readers won't probably be able to relate.
(But, eh, I'm writing these notes for myself.)

The more I think about my past experiences and what I liked about them,
and about what I'd like to do next and contribute,
the more I realise I'm like [Jos√©phine Ange-Gardien](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9phine,_ange_gardien).

Someone who **loves** trouble.
Someone who is motivated by **messy** situations.
Maybe, simply someone who likes a challenge?

But, and that's where the analogy holds up:
Not only I like resolving complex intricate situations.

I like to disappear and move on to something else once it's done.

I don't dream of being a CEO of a growing company ([[Why CEO?]]).
I dream of jumping from problems to problems.
