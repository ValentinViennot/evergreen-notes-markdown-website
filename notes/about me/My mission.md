## To enhance individual and collective human intelligence, while ensuring my happiness and those of others around me.

**My mission statement is a vow to act as a catalyst for elevating intelligence, both individual and collective. This duality seeks to create a virtuous cycle between individuals and community improvements. As one can only pour from a full cup, ensuring my happiness and those of others around me is a whole part of my mission.**

My mission goes beyond making people smarter. I see it as a foundation for tackling some of the most complex challenges that our society faces today—like climate change, political division, and social inequality.

When I talk about elevating intelligence, I'm not just referring to schoolbook knowledge. I mean nurturing the kind of deep thinking that helps us solve big, intricate problems. Think about climate change. We need brilliant minds to innovate and find solutions. But we also need collective intelligence to embrace sustainable choices.

Intelligence alone isn’t enough. We've all seen smart people make bad decisions because they were unhappy or stressed. That's why I include well-being. Happy people are not just content; they're motivated, innovative, and cooperative. They're more likely to vote, act, make choices that benefit everyone else.

The cycle feeds itself. Smarter, happier people make smarter, happier communities. Those communities are better equipped to face systemic issues, from city halls to the united nations. And as we do so, we grow, learn, and get even smarter as a collective.

For this virtuous cycle to spin, it has to start somewhere. By focusing on my happiness, I'm not just improving myself. I'm evolving into a better leader, partner, and problem-solver. That makes me more effective in my mission and, by extension, makes us all more capable of meeting the challenges ahead.

**Smarter, happier people don't just make a better "me" or a better "you." They make a better "us," capable of facing whatever comes our way.**
