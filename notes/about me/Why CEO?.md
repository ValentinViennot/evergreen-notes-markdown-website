I am a very technical person and would probably make a good CTO.
As a versatile catalyst ([[What's my edge?]]), I'm an easy fit.
(Despite having sometimes a tough [[Personality]])

However I am mostly interested in driving visions forward.
I love designing and finding the best business models.
I like challenging, contentious situations.
I am focused on the value I'm adding.

As the Vision owner, I need to spend almost half of my days [[Writing]].
And because of the [[Manager schedule vs Maker schedule]] dilemma,
I also have to hold half of my days for all kind of meetings.

Because I'm a believer that [[Having to force you to close your laptop at 6pm is a good sign]] ([[The kind of culture I want to create]]),
I can't spend more than twice half days on most days.

Therefore, for any technical ideas,
I need a partner who would be spending half of their day writing specs and code.
([[Gladly we're two!]])

Fortunately, I'm a very good catalyst for [[Technical Edge]] profiles.

My own technical background and experience,
and my obsessive personality ([[Obsessions]]) have made me highly demanding.
([[Good CTO, Great CTO]])

My thing is that I get excited about being in charge of the vision until what I was aiming to solve is eventually resolved.
I won't hesitate to get my hands dirty and be technical when needed.
But that's not, that cannot be, my priority.

Then I would typically step down and join a position giving me remote influence (eg Board tenure), and move on to another role where my skills are a better fit (than the ones of a CEO creating and maintaining a management culture & building resources).

My top skills and traits are:

- Broad, high-level understanding of a system's dynamics
- Deep understanding (or ability to learn) of technical implications
- A passion for pitching and improving my stories
- An instinct for complex thinking, strategic vision, and writing
- Theories and opinions on most topics
- A facility to switch between thinking macro and micro
- Persuading and convincing others
- Connecting thoughts and leveraging skills
- Game planning

What I'm not good at:

- Not falling into rabbit holes (especially when talking)
- Sticking to a solution ([[Just do it]])
- Technical realism (sometimes...)
