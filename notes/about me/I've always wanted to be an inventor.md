I've always wanted to be an Inventor.  
  
Those who've known me long enough know that it's been guiding me all along. My first hunch was that Tech and Engineering would let me do this. So, I first graduated with a CS Engineering degree fromÂ [INSA Lyon - Institut National des Sciences AppliquÃ©es de Lyon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/insa-lyon/)Â , working in parallel for three fantastic years atÂ [IBM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm/)Â as a Software Engineer. Now, I knew how to build things.  
  
But after spending a semester atÂ [EPFL (Ã‰cole polytechnique fÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/epfl/)Â and meeting so many people full of dreams, I understood that Entrepreneurship would actually allow me to invent things. I figured Product Management was the closest job to being an Entrepreneur without the hard parts of raising funding and hiring (well, this last one turned out not to be true). So, I joinedÂ [Canonical](https://www.linkedin.com/company/canonical/)Â and spent three years building a team and reinventingÂ [Ubuntu](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ubuntu-linux/)Â container images. And we didn't disappoint.  
  
I am now ready to take on the hard parts as well. â€”there's no reward without risk.  

And, who knows, maybe I'll end up building [[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]]. ðŸ‘€
