Just as [[My mission]] is about the destination,
this note —My values— is about How to get there.

## Unrelenting Self-Elevation

Challenge yourself constantly to become better—intellectually, physically, and financially. Aim for deeper understanding and higher well-being.

## Intellectual Bravery

Always question the status quo. Look for better ways to do things, driven by your innate curiosity and desire for complex problem-solving. (As opposed to Intellectual Laziness?).

## Collectivism

Work not just for your welfare but for the good of the community. Influence positively and create beneficial change. Systemic changes that better society as a whole.

## Unapologetic Authenticity

Be unapologetically yourself, loyal to the curious child you once were. Never accept the world as it is just because others tell you so. Live your life as you dream it.

## Kindness

Operate on the principle that there's no valid reason to be unkind. Acknowledge that you never have the complete picture of someone else's life or thoughts, just as they don't have yours. Extend kindness as an investment in a virtuous cycle, where good deeds have a way of coming back around.

## Inspirational Idealism

Enthusiastically advocate for what you believe, meaningful change with an understanding of the larger picture. Power is a tool, not a goal. Your idealism should inspire others to seek out the bigger picture and participate in achieving it.

## Empathetic Independence

Make independent, pragmatic choices that are grounded in empathy and emotional intelligence. Always be mindful of how your decisions align with broader goals.

## Open Engagement

Promote open dialogue and honest conduct. Trust but verify, and have the courage to express yourself unreservedly. [[Building in public]].

## Radical Candour

Believe in unfiltered, complete sharing of information. With yourself and with others. Avoid holding back details for the betterment of collective growth.

## Mission

Be all in, always with an eye on the lasting change you want to effect. Be willing to make tough calls that align with [[My mission]]. Work hard for what you believe in.

## Pragmatism

Make utility and efficiency your decision making top metrics. Prioritise what aligns with your mission & values, and dismiss what doesn't. Don't waste time on others problems.

## Balance

Aim for a harmonious balance in your health, emotional well-being, and intellectual growth. Aspire to fully know yourself.

## Ownership

Take full responsibility for your actions, both the good and the bad. Accept failure.

## Empowered Meritocracy

Identify and nurture the inherent intellectual and creative potential in each individual. Reward and leverage these capabilities for the accomplishment of complex objectives.

## Experiment

Give it a try. Methodically experiment new things, evaluate the results and commit to pragmatically, logically take action to re-assess the direction.
[[Experiment, Evaluate, Adjust, Repeat]].
