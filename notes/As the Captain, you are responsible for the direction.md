[[Not everyone is a Leader]]. And that's perfectly fine. But Leaders are here to help others achieve their potential, not to become (even benevolent) dictators.

Some situations will require YOU as a leader to make decisions. Not everyone will understand all your decisions. But you need their trust. 

Open yourself to others, make yourself vulnerable.
[[Leaders build Trust by being vulnerable, predictable, and celebrating the journey]].

Don't forget to win battles on the way and celebrate your small wins.
[[The Grand Vision is a destination, but what matters most is the journey]].

Don't change your dream if you don't want to.
But be ready to adjust the navigation course based on events.
