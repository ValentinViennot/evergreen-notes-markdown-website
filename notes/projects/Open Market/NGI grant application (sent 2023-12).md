TIMELINE—RELEVANCE—PUBLIC GOOD

The **Next Generation Internet (NGI)** is a European Commission initiative that aims to shape the development and evolution of the Internet into an Internet of Trust. An Internet that responds to people’s fundamental needs, including trust, security, and inclusion, while reflecting the values and the norms all citizens enjoy in Europe.

RESILIENT. SUSTAINABLE. OPEN.

The Next Generation Internet fosters diversity and decentralisation and grows the potential for a **sustainably open** environment for our cultures and economies, celebrating our values, promoting creativity and respecting the environment.

NGI supports the upgrading of Internet infrastructure for better security and privacy. Projects also cover ways to increase network performances and make the Internet more energy efficient.

Open-source software is at the heart of many NGI projects which make an important contribution to the open source community.

CORE FUND

We are looking for troubleshooters that help society tackle the ossification of the internet and other hard but very very important challenges, each of which has significant social and economic consequences. We need new ideas and disruptive core technologies, while at the same time evolving and growing existing technologies that are still enough future-proof. The project results become available under an open source license, so anyone can read and validate ,the source code, and anyone can use the code to create technology that fits their own purposes. The right to reuse and right to repair not only allow for unrestricted scrutiny and permissionless innovation, but also help to reduce e-waste. And the use of standards enables interoperability and redundancy in implementation to reduce the risk of compromise and failure.  
We are seeking project proposals between 5.000 and 50.000 euro’s — with the possibility to scale them up if there is proven potential.  
Reliability, confidentiality, integrity, security, and resource efficiency should be the ‘new normal’ of the internet, something ordinary users should not have to worry about — users should be in control. So let’s make it happen.

ENTRUST FUND

We need a more resilient, trustworthy and open internet, empowering the end-users. Trust is only justified and sustainable if it the technology in question is up for the job, and is secure-by-design as well as trustworthy. Much of the software, services and devices does not measure up, and it is quite unlikely this will just improve by itself. NGI0 Entrust is designed to move beyond the status quo and create a virtuous cycle of innovation through free and open source software, libre hardware and open standards. If we want everyone to use and benefit from the internet to its full potential without holding back, the internet must be built on strong and transparent technologies that allow for permission-less innovation and are equally accessible to all.

### Abstract: Can you explain the **whole project** and its expected outcome(s).

The Open Market is a platform for crowd-investment in open source communities, tokenizing brand equity as a measure of innovation potential; reinventing organizations for the knowledge economy.

The knowledge economy, characterized by non-rivalrous digital goods, has led to excessive capital accumulation and a preference for exploitation over creation.

In our economic model, intellectual property and human labor are not free. This axiomatically differs from the free software principles, explaining the challenge that open-source projects face in capturing their created value. This isn't a funding but an incentives problem.

The Open Market is making open source an attractive investment through a parallel economy, where brand equity shares represent future investment in money and effort. This model allows anyone to contribute to a project directly, aligning stakeholders on governance and quality. Leveraging crowdfunding and speculation incentives, it commodifies and tokenizes open source value, shifting the investment focus from marginal profits to durable investment.

"The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones." —John Maynard Keynes.

### Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions?

Deeply committed to the free software ideology, I had inventing an economic model to sustain free innovation on my mind for multiple years. As such, I have been thinking, discussing, and writing the principles and mechanics of this new economy in depth.

For the past three years, I immersed myself in the open source world by working as a product manager with Canonical (Ubuntu)'s founder and CEO. Before that, I was working for IBM as a programmer.

I am an entrepreneur with a strong technical background, having graduated a masters in communication systems engineering. I am passionate about technology, design, society, economy and finance.

For the past three months, I joined the "Entrepreneur First" incubator in Paris in order to give a startup birth to the Open Market project. I have been maturing the idea, learning and validating it from intensive market research and user interviews.

Exploring Venture Capital funding options, I realized that they themselves perpetuate the cycle of tech monopolies and the fundamental economic problems that I'd identified (exploitation vs creation). I therefore concluded that VC funding was incompatible with the transformative change I aim to bring about.

My goal right now is to build the first step of this vision: a crowdfunding platform based on the valuation of brand equity shares. The next step will be the Open Market protocol.
Building an audience and this first step, I intend to validate market potential and attract talent.

### Explain what the requested budget will be **used** for?  Does the project have other funding sources, both past and present?   (If you want, you can in addition attach a budget at the bottom of the form)

The Open Market project has no funding sources as of now.

We are exploring options. Our current committed plan is first bootstrapping a simple crowdfunding platform based on brand valuation, and then using it to fund itself further.

This request is about the initial crowdfunding platform leading to the Open Market protocol.

Overall, the intended use of the requested budget is first to cover the bootstrapping costs (detailed below) and then to inject as grease to ease our new economic system.

We split the requested 50000 euros into three categories.

1. BOOTSTRAPPING COSTS (7800 euros)

1.1 company incorporation costs (administrative, legal, accounting)—800 euros
1.2 legal counseling for Licensing, Trademark and Securities law—2500 euros
1.3 enterprise finance assistance for instruments & securities structuration—2500 euros
1.4 travel costs to FOSDEM to present the platform to relevant projects—600 euros
1.5 graphic and design work—900 euros
1.6 set up landing page with vision and mission, roadmap, messaging—250 euros
1.7 set up social media profiles, communication channels, and community discourse—250 euros

(1) TOTAL: 7800 euros

2. PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT (25200 euros)

We have budgeted an incremental amount to get our initial platform on rails.

Eventually, we foresee the Open Market as an open, decentralized protocol materializing the free innovation market and financial infrastructure.

Our proposed strategy is to first capitalize off-chain, curated FLOSS brands with a crowdfunding approach rewarding brand equity in shares to projects backers.
The intention is to build a quality audience and substantial capital before generalizing access to a liquid token exchange that will—by nature—encourage more short-term speculators to join.

Speculators aren't inherently a bad thing as they help realize price discovery and increase liquidity. However, a market with only speculators would lead to undesirable outcomes. Therefore, we believe this off-chain stage to be an essential part of the journey. In analogy to the stock market, the proposed crowdfunding platform is the equivalent of a distributed VC fund.

2.1 MILESTONE #1: SIMPLE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM FOR FLOSS BRAND EQUITY

2.1.1 technical architecture and design
2.1.2 set up the website and initial infrastructure (with emphasis on security)
2.1.3 projects can define crowdfunding milestones rewarding brand equity to backers
2.1.4 users can browse projects, milestones, and buy brand equity to invest in any project
2.1.5 backers can own brand equity shares and download all the relevant documentation

Estimated effort: 4 weeks (~160h) — Rate: 35 euros
(2.1) TOTAL: 5500 euros

2.2 MILESTONE #2: INTEGRATING WITH EXTERNAL END-TO-END PLATFORMS

2.2.1 technical architecture and design
2.2.2 infrastructure upgrade to support new features
2.2.3 integrate with external platforms to support more reward goals (bounties, etc.)
2.2.4 contributors can claim brand equity shares for their valuable project contributions

Estimated effort: 4 weeks (~160h) — Rate: 35 euros
(2.1) TOTAL: 5500 euros

2.3 MILESTONE #3: EXCHANGE DESIGN AND INCENTIVES EXPERIMENTS

2.3.1 technical architecture and design
2.3.2 infrastructure upgrade to support new features
2.3.3 backers can resell their brand equity shares through a market maker (2nd hand)
2.3.4 users can open 'request for solutions' (RFS) with backing stakes in tokens
2.3.5 curators can propose 'design proposals' (DP) to match projects and RFS
2.3.6 users, projects, and contributors can approve DP with a tokenized stake
2.3.7 projects can transform DP to Milestones to Implemented and claim the stake

Estimated effort: 5 weeks (~200h) — Rate: 35 euros
(2.3) TOTAL: 7100 euros

2.4 MILESTONE #4: OPEN MARKET EXCHANGE BOOTSTRAP

2.4.1 design of the open market trading protocol (white paper)
2.4.2 open market exchange simulations and impact study
2.4.3 open market protocol implementation proposal

Estimated effort: 5 weeks (~200h) — Rate: 35 euros
(2.4) TOTAL: 7100 euros

NB: ideally, for this (2.4) stage, we would like to partner with schools of economics to leverage the open market platform and parameters as an experiment to understand and assess the created incentives and generated economic value.

3. INITIAL FLOSS BRANDS VALUATION AND MARKETPLACE LIQUIDITY (17000 euros)

The goal here is to provide market liquidity until enough participants are actively trading.
The Curation Market (see paper attached) model allow for permanent liquidity, but for the market to properly perform its price discovery function and for contributors to be able to liquidate their brand equity shares at a fair rate, additional liquidity will at first be required.
We propose to play this role with "airdrops", smart fund-matching, investments and arbitrage mechanisms. In order to execute these mechanisms we will need cash. That's what this part of the requested budget is about: adding grease to ease our economic system.

We commit to only back projects with free and libre open-source (OSI-approved) licences.

In addition, we decide to prioritize the backing of projects that are:
- privacy first
- end-user facing
- messaging, social networks, user productivity apps (preferred themes)

The exact allocation methodology will depend on the traction generated by the platform.

### **Compare** your own project with existing or historical efforts.

The Open Market project introduces a groundbreaking approach by using Brand Equity Tokens as shares in open source Trademarks for project valuation. This method transforms the economic landscape, distinctly different from existing models.

Our core innovation lies in applying the decentralized Curation Market model (see white paper attached in appendix). This realigns the incentives of all parties involved—from governance to contributors, users, and investors (curators). It aims to cultivate projects with high-value brands, ultimately maximizing the utility.

While similar in some aspects to stock market exchanges and platforms like GitCoin, Tea Protocol, OpenCollective, Polar.sh, OnlyDust, OSS Capital, Aktionariat, Tip4commit, and GitHub Sponsors, our project diverges significantly in its foundational principles. Unlike these initiatives, which operate within traditional economic frameworks, the Open Market challenges the root causes of funding issues in open source: mainly, the current axiomatic requirement in our dominant economic system to exploit intellectual property for marginal profits.

Our model introduces a radical shift in economics—prioritizing value creation over exploitation. Embracing the free nature of software, we encourage rapid innovation by trading shares in future investment capacity rather than future costs and profits. This is enabled by the non-rivalrous nature of software goods (and any intellectual property) that only requires R&D costs and low-to-no recurring production costs. The focus is on user experience and utility, not margins. The Open Market allows for diverse investment motivations, from financial speculation to utility-driven contributions. This flexibility is key to our inclusive approach.

We blur the lines between traditional roles. Users, contributors, and investors can now join forces, financially incentivized to drive innovation in an aligned direction.

We proudly define ourselves as the finance arm of the free software movement.

### What are significant technical **challenges** you expect to solve during the project, if any?)

We foresee two types of potentially significant technical challenges:
- Brand Equity valuation and trading mechanisms design,
- Integration with existing platforms.

The fundamentally-novel economic system that we are proposing relies on designing the right financial incentives that are both motivating-enough yet sustainable, and most importantly that are aligned for all participants. Designing these incentives properly will require a fair share of economics (and tokenomics), mathematics (especially game theory), and social experimentations. We foresee the getting the Open Market economics right and aligned to be our biggest technical challenge.

Ultimately, what we are building is the backbone of a new economy but isn't an end-to-end solution by itself. To bring this model and ideas to life, our system requires being integrated somewhere in between user-facing solutions and high-utility open-source projects. We envision integrating with feature-level and roadmap crowdfunding, backers funding, bounty, donations, and other existing funding solutions. The goal will be to provide them with the ability to leverage brand equity shares rather than simple cash transactions in order to transform the systemic game incentives.

### Describe the **ecosystem** of the project, and how you will engage with relevant actors and promote the outcomes?

The Open Market project is a four-sided market place, between users, contributors, projects governance, and investors; its ultimate goal is to facilitate value exchanges between all of these participants, driven by the underlying utility of the open-source projects. These trades are the value creation part of our proposal.

Our initial ecosystem focus will be on community-organized open-source projects building end-user solutions with a focus on privacy, social networks and productivity.

We will actively need to engage with open-source projects and contributors, as well as users and investors. For that, we envision multiple complementary approaches:

- Starting a movement with online presence (website, forums, social networks),
- Collaborative efforts to define and design the Open Market foundations,
- Attending open source conferences to engage and present our proposal,
- Seek investment participation from public funds and private equity investors,
- Reach out to selected strategic open source projects with strong audiences,
- Become part of similar, aligned online communities (eg Shelling Point group),
- Publish and share digital content (videos, blogs, posts, etc) campaigns,

Once the foundations are up, we will prioritize initiatives that directly add value to open source projects and their users (eg, feature-level crowdfunding integration).
