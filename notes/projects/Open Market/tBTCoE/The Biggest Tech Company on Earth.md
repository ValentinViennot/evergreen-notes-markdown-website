## The Biggest Tech Company on Earth _(TM)_

### Why 

**[[The way we innovate is totally inefficient]].**

- Happens in isolation and secrecy
- Heavily influenced by chance
- Wasting lots of resources

### How 

**[[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]].**

- Collaborative and Transparent
- Cheapest cost (consumer)
- 0$ barrier to entry

### What

We are building **the biggest Investment Fund and Platform in Open Source Software**.

Investing in the (future) [[Brand Value]] of Open Source projects, as projected by the estimated amount of long-term investment (capital).

**[[Open Source Software as a Commodity -Pioneering profitable FLOSS venture capital]]**

Conceptually, **the biggest Open Source Software Distribution**. (OSSD?).

- Today, the biggest Open Source Software Distribution is GitHub.
- Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc are also big Open Source Software Distributions. 

#### Win strategy & Addressable market

[[Nothing can compete with Open Source]] (provided it gets funded).

That's how we will win over the entire Tech market/industry.

**The total addressable market is expressed in trillions**.

As soon as Open Source becomes a profitable investment, therefore becoming a driving force for open source entrepreneurs to build tech that will compete with Big Tech solutions, all the tech will progressively shift to our new economy for funding.

Eventually, all tech will be open source.

Freeing innovation. Freeing workers. Freeing knowledge.

#### Problem Statement

Of course, you might oppose that [[Open Source is not profitable]].

([[Tell me it's impossible and I'll do it]])

#### Root cause analysis

[[Why is Open Source not profitable? (Essay)]]

Tldr, the open source axioms are opposed to our dominant economy definition:
- human labour is considered as a production mean to create intellectual property,
- intellectual property is considered a production mean that is exploited for profit.

In Open Source,
- intellectual property (IP) is the instant value and must be free,
- labour creating this value must also be free.

This certainly doesn't mean that Open Source cannot be an economic system.
In fact, it can even be a 'capitalist' system as it doesn't reject profitability.

- Shareholders (current) and contributors (new) both are free value creators,
- Margins (current) and IP (new) both are arbitrary societal value,

In both systems, Innovation is a race and profit goes to the winners of the race.
That's what drives technical progress forward ([GNU manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html)).

**The problem is that the current global economic system does not value IP.**

#### Solution: a new System

**Systemic issues can only be solved with systemic solutions.**

In many ways, the Open Source profitability issue reminds us of the [[Tragedy of the Commons]]. When a resource is scarce but free and that there's no economic incentive for economic agents to either limit themselves or contribute back to its development ; agents will take as much as they can from the Commons and eventually lead to its total destruction. The currently dominant free market situation thus leads to situations like climate change, biodiversity depletion, or the alarming current open source financials.

Open source might seem inconsequential when compared to solving Climate Change or Biodiversity Depletion. Yet, I do believe it's at the root cause of everything. In fact, the genesis of Open Source comes from the highly destructive and inefficient innovation model that our society currently uses and proposes a functional alternative.

If we could de-correlate progress (innovation) from growth (production), then a de-growth model would be acceptable. And a de-growth model is the only credible solution in order to have a shot at addressing the climate and biodiversity crisis.

Open source, open innovation, is a perfectly adequate alternative to our current innovation model ([[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]]). However, it didn't come with an economic model to sustain and grow it further. Instead, it gave up and accepted that —as open source maintainers— it wasn't going to be profitable.

**We propose to build a new economy within the global economy: the Open Market.**

[[Open Market Economy]] aims to:

1. Be an excellent player in the traditional, global economy,
2. Abide by (and not compromise on) the [[Open Source should always be Free|Open Source Principles]].

[[The Open Market]] proposes a Curation Market to profitably invest in the future of open-source solutions. **Crowdfunding technical progress de-correlated from production.**

In order to bring it to life, we propose to build **[[The Open Market Infrastructure]]**.

##### Product: The Biggest Tech Company on Earth ("Our Company")

Our Company is enabled by this new financial infrastructure.
Effectively, turning open source projects into valuable (financial) commodities.

Our Company is an **Investment Fund in Open Source Software**,
operating in the newly created [[Open Market Economy|Open Market Economy]] and
pioneering profitable FOSS venture capital.

The added value of Our Company comes from ([[tBTCoE company vision and culture]]):

- Strategy & Partnerships
- Brand (Reputation)
- Global Partners
- Culture

Our **unfair advantage** is that we are the ones who created the new Economy.
As such, we develop strategies, partnerships, and reputation that are non-reproducible.

We believe that by freeing workers we will increase productivity by 30%.
We believe that by freeing innovation we will take over the entire tech market.
We believe that by freeing knowledge we will eventually attract most investments.

We know the rules and could understand them better than anyone.
Our Company valuation and profitability exclusively comes from [[Creative Labour]] ([[Human Labour is what creates Value]]) (—as opposed to assets, like IP).

We will channel investments into open source from consumers and investors.
This positioning will give us incredible insights into the "needs" market (read how in [[tBTCoE company vision and culture]]).
We will use these insights to invest in the future leading open source ventures.
We will invest time and money, funding open source projects and entrepreneurs.

The investments come in different forms and from different actors.

- Consumers & Investors: Money
- Project: Influence (Brands)
- Contributors: Time

([Capital: Money, Time, Influence](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/all-we-do-is-investment/) - [[blog/posts/investing-time/index|source]])

###### Business Model and Positioning

Our Company will need to operate an [[Open Market Exchange]] (OME) on [[The Open Market Infrastructure]] (and federated with the [[Open Market Foundation]]) in order to create [[Open Market Economy]] required to run our investment business.

The OME business **must have separate accounting** ([FTX bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX)).

We don't need the OME business to be competitive and , in fact , it is expected that its value will eventually get commoditised (as we will hand over the [[Open Market Protocol]] to the [[Open Market Foundation]] and open-source the platform code).

In terms of positioning, it might even be strategic for our OME to be non-competitive.
Comparing with the role of Luxury Brands vs Everyday Brands in the retail market, our OME would provide thought leadership and focus on product innovation. Our role will be to define the future and enable the market, but not to address the mass. We can leave this opportunity to competitors and voluntarily create a healthy gap for competitors in the market by increasing our OME fees ([Marketing Comparison between Luxury Brands and Everyday Brands, Xinyi Chen, California college of the arts, 2023](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368465649_Marketing_Comparison_between_Luxury_Brands_and_Everyday_Brands)).

Our biggest revenue streams are, in order:

1. Returns on Investments
2. Investment fees (channeling Consumers and Investors capital)
3. OME fees

Not ordered, the following methods could be used to capture created value:

- long term strategic investment in promising FOSS projects (VC bonding)
- % on funded contributors' contributions (incubator model)
- fees on high value services (LP investment fund model)
- problem-solving market (ie, get consumers to put a price on their issues)
- transaction fees
- token fees
- hedging instruments to benefit from market openings
- insurance/assurance model connecting consumers to the open source world
- bounty security funds (aligned interest)
- quadratic indexes (maintenance etc) (eg, CNCF, tLF, etc)
- hedging investment in the traditional economy (eg, short big tech)
- monetary investments in the traditional economy (utilising locked cash)
- consulting (eg "Unstatic Labs", ...)

**The more tech we disrupt the more demand for OSS we will create** (assurance and problem solving). By becoming the platform between consumers and OSS we will gain insights into their needs and be able to better bet on future successful projects.

_Revenue Hypothesis_: Problem-solving, Investment, Assurance.
_Growth Hypothesis_: Innovation drives innovation, FOSS is growing & will disrupt all tech.

Depending on execution, another strategy might be to run two brands of OME in parallel. A Luxury OME (tBTCoE) and an Everyday OME (API). The idea is to enable ideas and projects that could be running on [[The Open Market Infrastructure]] to simply access the network at-cost (but without the qualitative value adds of tBTCoE).

##### MVP: The Pilot. Connecting institutions to FOSS projects.

[[The Open Market White Paper (Method-Outline)]]

From [our research](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNf3aY_Y=/?share_link_id=404347573726) , the best starting point seem to be connecting institutions with a sovereignty deep-motivator to FOSS projects with our goal being to align incentives.

A Pilot program could be finding ways to do so by focusing on the consumer side, ie the institutions, and solving the current barriers in funding open-source software.

We need to validate the feasibility, desirability, viability and adaptability of such pilot program ([[Mapping Assumptions]]) from both ends. 

The goals of the pilot would be to:

- Experiment with incentives
- Establish ourselves with FOSS projects and fondations
- Proof-point our longer-term vision
- Become more trustable by compliantly working with institutions

The EU & French markets are perfect entry points ([[2023-10-12 Software (OSS projects) used by the DINUM]]).
