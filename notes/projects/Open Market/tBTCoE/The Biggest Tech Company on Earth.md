## The Biggest Tech Company on Earth _(TM)_

### Why 

**[[The way we innovate is totally inefficient]].**

- Happens in isolation and secrecy
- Heavily influenced by chance
- Wasting lots of resources

### How 

**[[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]].**

- Collaborative and Transparent
- Cheapest cost (consumer)
- 0$ barrier to entry

### What

We are building **the biggest Investment Fund and Platform in Open Source Software**.

Investing in the (future) [[Brand value]] of Open Source projects, as projected by the estimated amount of long-term investment (capital).

Conceptually, **the biggest Open Source Software Distribution**. (OSSD?).

- Today, the biggest Open Source Software Distribution is GitHub.
- Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc are also big Open Source Software Distributions. 

#### Win strategy & Addressable market

[[Nothing can compete with Open Source]] (provided it gets funded).

That's how we will win over the entire Tech market/industry.

#### Problem Statement

Of course, you might oppose that [[Open Source is not profitable]].

Well: [[Tell me it's impossible and I'll do it]].

#### Root cause analysis

[[Why is Open Source not profitable? (Essay)]]

**_**[[TODO]]**: Write down as thesis. See notes below._**

#### Solution: a new System

Systemic issues can only be solved with systemic solutions.

That's why we propose to build a new Economy within the Global Economy.

This new economic system needs to,

1. Be a good player in the traditional, Global Economy ([[Capitalism]])
2. Abide by (and not compromise on) the [[Open Source should always be Free|Open Source Principles]]

We propose to build **[[The Open Market Infrastructure]]**.

**_**[[TODO]]**: Explain top axioms. See notes below._**

##### Product: The Biggest Tech Company on Earth ("Our Company")

Our Company is enabled by this new financial infrastructure.

Our Company is an **Investment Fund in Open Source Software**,
operating in the newly created [[The Open Market Economy|Open Market Economy]].

The added value of Our Company comes from ([[tBTCoE company vision and culture]]):

- Culture
- Strategies
- Brand (Reputation)
- Employees & Partners

Our **unfair advantage** is that we are the ones who created the new Economy.

We therefore know the rules and could understand them better than anyone.
Our Company valuation and profitability exclusively comes from Human Labour ([[Human Labour is what creates Value]]) (as opposed to IP or resources).

The investment comes in different forms and from different actors.

- Consumers: Money
- Contributors: Time
- Investors: Capital



COMPANY MISSION: Free workers.
COMPANY VISION: Sustainably invest in Open Source.

##### MVP: Where to get started.

Two-sided marketplace (aka the biggest Open Source Software Distribution).
Validating our top [[Open Market Hypothesis|hypothesis]]. In particular that,

- Customers are willing to pay for future (OSS) development,
- Contributors are willing to work for future brand valuation tokens (and >$),
     --> recognition, unlimited (theoretical) profits, right to buy

Identifying:
- Customers: Big corps/companies relying on specific OSS
- Contributors: The said specific OSS projects and contributors


**_**[[TODO]]**: Write down as brief/pitch. See notes._**


##### Roadmap

[[TODO]]: private?

- [[Open Market Assumptions]] (old world)
- [[Open Market Hypothesis]] (new world)
- [[Open Market Postulates]] (old world)
- [[Open Market Axioms]] (new world)

- [[Open Market references]]

// [[TODO]] // WIP // Random notes // [[Open Market random notes (WIP)]]

In our current economy, Open Source projects can't be profitable because they don't generate (growing) enough revenue ([[Open Source should always be Free]]).

Why is that?

- In Open Source, IP and Labour are free
	- Where the Capitalist economy consider both them as production means
		- _Is "production means" the right term?_

- Create a new financial infrastructure/economy that allows for open source profits
	- designed for open source, based on a different economic paradigm
	- that is a good capitalist player as seen from the outside
		- growing revenue/profits
		- attracting always more investment
	- as the tech market will be disrupted,
		- that will eventually replace the tech economy

- The Biggest Tech Company on Earth = Two-sided market
	- 1. Consumers: Assurance
	- 2. Contributors: Open Market + The Biggest Tech Company on Earth
`
- Assurance:
	- We will distribute all of the Open Source Software (GitHub)
	- We will commit to resolve any bug or security issue
	- We will do that using an Insurance financial model
		- Many subscribers
			- Different pricing models (TBD!) based on:
				- Frequency of updates
					- As soon as available
					- Daily
					- Weekly
				- SLA (for a solution or patch)
					- 1 day/1 week/1 month
					- 1 month
					- None
				- Support availability (?)
					- 24/7
					- 12/5
					- None
			- 3 main subscriptions prices
				- And custom offers
					- Based on matrix of options ^^
						- Infra cost
						- Support engineering cost
						- Patching engineering cost
		- Minimising the risk, [[De-risking]]
			- Risk models
			- Predictive maintenance
			- Proactive research/engineering
	- And we will offer them to request us software improvements
		- Feature requests, pain points
			- **Requests For Proposals**
				- Consulting with Engineering and issuing a Feature bounty

- The Open Market (Efficiently, Systematically, Competitively subsidising)
	- Projects have their own governance
	- Brand valuations â€”**Trademarks**
		- Project coin = a share of the brand (legally!)
		- Doesn't mean anything wrt governance
	- Open Market Exchange to trade these coins
		- Subscribe to the Open Market Fondation
			- That develops the Open Market Protocol
				- Open source & Blockchain
					- For trustability (on both ends)
			- And the Open Market License
		- OME is a separate entity (accounting)
			- Financial entity
			- Will require a CISO, CFO, CRO
		- Open Market Exchange also has obligations,
			- Protect listed projects
				- Take legal action
				- Resolve any cheating, IP abuse, manipulation issue
			- Provide access to users, contributors, investors
			- Respect the protocol and rules by OMF
			- Pay a fee to the Open Market Fondation (OMF)
	- Projects are licensed with Open Market License
		- Derivatives must also be licensed with OML
		- Projects must be listed on at least one Open Market Exchange
			- recognised by the Open Market Fondation
		- Grants special rights to the Open Market Exchange
			- Use the Project Trademark
			- Build and distribute the project
	- Coin valuation reflects future investment
		- What is investment?
			- Work as investment (first-hand market)
				- Contributions are rewarded with Coin
					- Project governance decides what, how...
						- Offer/demand competitive market regulates
			- Customer requests (cost) as investments (first-hand market)
				- Customers pay for feature development
			- Speculation as investment (second-hand market)
				- Investors
		- Coin can either be created or destroyed
			- It can't be traded
				- A "trade" is a destruction<->creation
			- The Coin price is determined with a Mathematical formula
				- That is a "healthy Ponzi Scheme"
					- Ie , that reflects future investments.
						- As opposed to future profits.
					- This Ponzi scheme is _leaking_
						- As in,
							- 1/ work is considered an investment
							- 2/ allow for leaking parameters?
		- 
	- How to solve the problem of developers working benevolently on project?
		- AND, same problem for project leaders?
		- Idea:
			- Offer them Options (BSPCE) , funded with credit/locked value
			- (Risk? Taken by them & the project? --> be transparent)
				- Leadership shouldn't allow this.
					- WOULD THAT ALLOW TO STEAL MONEY?
						- Or just make an investment more speculative?
							- And therefore less attractive?
								- (In which case it's "fine")

- **Become the first Open Source Investment Fund**

- tBTC: UBI and Bug Bounty
	- Best tech employees
		- Pay them UBI and reward them Bounty
			- Internal alerts for reactivity to customer SLA
				- Risk model / Price
- What makes tBTC valuable is like for law firms
	- Human Labour (ie not going to be disrupted by our new economy)
		- Partner
- We do destroy value.
	- Which means more innovation will have to happen faster.
		- But this is (one of) the goal(s).
- Europe disrupt
	- European-based
		- Avoid unfair competition
		- Easier economics
		- Partner with Europe
			- Goal to open to US though, in order to disrupt more
				- And then to elsewhere too(?)

- Where to get started?
	- Better define the vision, ie HOW DOES IT WORK exactly
		- ie, the postulates and thesis and formulas
			- ie, The New Economy
				- [[The Open Market Economy]]
	- Validate biggest hypothesis that will generate profit

		- Two-sided market: need to care about both sides

			- ""**Contributors will want to contribute to Open Market**""
				- (Can be tested based on Interviews and Prototypes)
					- **(+ Ask them to be available for freelancing, initially)**
						- WITH A PROMISE OF REWARD ONCE IMPLEMENTED
				- **ie they'd rather have brand shares over cash**
					- LEAKING
						- Can be for eg leaking "future" coin (ie coin option)
							- Parameters defined by Leadership of projects
				- Developer Coins?

			- ""**Customers will fund future OSS features**""
				- THIS IS WHERE I WOULD START
				- Willing to pay US to do work in an OSS project
					- That everyone else will benefit from
						- **Need to partner with the OSS first**

				- Request for proposals (PROOF OF STAKE)
					- Blocked money on Pain points until Problem solved
					- Projects Leadership decide what proposal wins
					- Contributors get back created coin (PROOF OF WORK)
						- They can destroy or keep it
				- COIN IS EITHER CREATED OR DESTROYED , not traded.

	- Open Organisations
		- Recognition (share of what you are building)
		- Incubator
			- Developer Coins? â€”EF-style
		- Investment fund

		- The creators side is less high-priority ([[Move with urgency]])
			- Take the example of Spotify
				- What they were aiming to do was REALLY hard 
				- 
	- Web3 is an implementation detail
		- Not integrated with other Web3 shit
	- "Don't give up on reality. The Web3 integrated with the real world."
		- OME and OMF protect their participants
			- Regulate and take legal action if necessary
				- NEED REGULATORY POWER!!
					- TRUST IS BACK :)
						- Decentralised doesn't mean without local centres
							- Distributed!
		- "Innovation made more human."
		- "Open Source will always be free."
		- ...
- DON'T GROW TOO FAST
	- Only European at first
	- Invitation only
	- ==> IN ORDER TO GET RETRIBUTED
		- (platform is open)
- Not your typical crypto project
	- Creating actual value
	- Abiding by known and tangible rules
	- Regulated by locally centralised bodies


- UBI
	- Motivates
	- Based on performance
	- And added value to the network
		- Ie convinced to pay user bounty
	- Regional markets
		- Code global --> Open Source
		- Bounty regional

...

1. Ambition
2. Business model (ie Incubator / Investment Fund).
3. How? Two-sided market.
	1. OSS assurance
	2. Open Market
		1. New creators Economy
			1. Value = How much work and feature requests in the future
		2. New investment opportunities
4. Long-term value:
	1. Partners
	2. Culture
	3. Investment expertise (we built the game!)
	4. Assurance revenue

So, yes, I'm going to build **the biggest tech company on earth**.
