## The Biggest Tech Company on Earth

**BELIEVE. THINK. BUILD.**

Making Open Source dependable and durably innovative

### Mission

To free workers.

### Vision

Become the Biggest Tech Company on Earth (tBTCoE) by
profitably investing in Open Source Software —future— development. Therefore, freeing Intellectual Property and Workers.

### Business

- Gather money from Open Source users to invest in the future of software
- Put a price tag on real-world problems, empower problem bounty hunters
- Enable a new Open Economy with infrastructure, culture, and resources
- Attract investors' capital to fund innovation that will attract more investment
- Fund and empower the smartest brains on the planet to deliver creative value
- Develop investment strategies and build investor reputation as tBTCoE
- Hire the best Talents as Partners and build with them the future of innovation

#### Customers

Our Company customers will be businesses from the traditional economy that are making profit from using Open Source Software. (for now, we plan to let the B2C market to other Open Market-powered solutions ([[Open Market APIs Project Ideas]])).

**We will offer them two clear value propositions:**

1. **Assurance**. We will contractually commit to take on the risk and liability of the Open Source Software that they use. We will build processes and capacity to resolve security and software issues with convincing SLAs.

2. **Problem-solving**. We will collaborate with our customers to understand the problems they encounter running their businesses, as much general pain points as specific problems with the software they use. We will offer consulting services to help them put a price on these problems. On the other hand, we will invest and fund Open Source projects and contributors that can find solutions to these problems.

_([[TODO]]: Pay-for-play vs Subscription-Audible-type model?)_

#### Technology

Our Company will run on [[The Open Market Infrastructure]].

Effectively becoming the first investment fund of [[The Open Market Economy]].

Therefore, we will operate an [[Open Market Exchange]]. This will be a separate legal entity, owned by tBTCoE. We will ensure transparency and proper accounting.

We will support the independence of the [[Open Market Fondation]].

### Culture

#### Offices: Station F 3.0

Something like the Station F in Paris, huge modern co-working buildings filled with Entrepreneurs. _(Located in all big and less big cities! Europe first.)_

The tBTCoE Leadership would have their offices in the middle (like [[Elon Musk]] at the center of the factory). Leaders would be expected to come to the office regularly.

Any Open Market contributor would be able to come and work from tBTCoE offices.
It will be like a giant co-working space, mixing funded Entrepreneurs and free minds.

It will be the heart of innovation, a race to the highest creative value.

#### Employees 

We will hire the best tech workers and give them freedom and job security.

We will fund the best open source contributors to work on what they want to.

**We won't offer the biggest salaries. We offer de-alienation, freedom, security.**

We distinguish two types of employees: Partners and Contributors.
##### Partners

Partners are part of the Company Leadership. They make strategic decisions to improve our Reputation and Brand Value.

They are responsible for the performance of the Investment Fund.

Each Partner is responsible for a portfolio of contributors and investments.
##### Contributors

Contributors are the Open Source Entrepreneurs.

Just like [[EF]] does with traditional Entrepreneurs, we fund them to achieve their potential.

#### Added value

##### Culture, Problem-solving obsessed

###### Two-sided market

Our Company, tBTCoE, is conceptually a two-sided market between the old, traditional economy and the new, Open Economy ([[The Open Market Economy]]).

One one end, we serve users, customers of Open Source Software solutions.
On the other end, we serve Open Source Contributors, the new Entrepreneurs.

###### The biggest Open Source Software distribution

Conceptually, it can also be seen as the biggest OSS distribution.

We must become really obsessed with creating real-world value and solving problems
([[Human Labour is what creates Value]]).

For that, we will create an entrepreneurship culture to drive freed workers.
###### No rules rules

**We believe in the [[No rules rules]] approach.**

Our mission is to create the right incentives and systemic context so that on both ends contributors are driven to invest (time, money) in the future of innovative projects.

Our company won't enforce any rules beyond the rules of the game (ie Open Market).
Our employees will be free workers, free to invest their time as they believe is best.

We will create the culture and offer the resources and means for them to succeed.

Regularly, we will assess **employees performance as measured with their ROI**.

We will let them enough time to succeed, acting exactly like an Incubator.

Partners will be responsible for the performance of their portfolios of Contributors and Investments. They will make arbitration decisions such as letting go of staff.

###### Universal Base Income

At tBTCoE, **EVERYONE gets the same salary**: similar to a Universal Base Income. 

Leaders (=Partners) will also get shares in Our Company.

Entrepreneurs (=Contributors) will also get shares in the Open Source projects they contributed to with socially valuable work. They decide where to invest their time.

###### Free workers

[[Happy workers are better workers]].

##### Processes, Coordination

**One of the Key Missions of tBTCoE will be to coordinate effort.**

Contributors are free to work on what they want and believe in.

However, we will build the tools and infrastructures and strategies to **help them identify and work on the most valuable problems worth solving.**

Partners will be responsible to build a vision and influence strategic investments.

For example, we would have "problem bounties" that will get funded based on confidential interactions and partnerships with the biggest companies of the traditional economy (tBTCoE's customers). Contributors would get exposed to these problem bounties through an internal portal and start problem hunting and problem solving.

##### Partners, Reputation, Strategy

Our Company value will mostly come from its Human contributions.
Which is something intrinsically impossible to commoditise.

We will elaborate investment strategies based on our experience and data.
With the **unfair advantage** that WE created the New Open Economy.
(Although anyone is able to join and become an Exchange!).

> It is essential that the new Open Economy is completely open to new participants.
> This will be the role of the [[Open Market Fondation]] to make fair decisions.
> We are creating a New Economy, not just a startup.
> Our startup is "just" the biggest player in this New Economy.
> And, eventually, the biggest tech player in the traditional economy.

We will attract the best Talents and have them become Partners (analogy with Law Firms and Investment Funds).

Partners have shares of tBTCoE and are **the enablers of the value creation**.
They are responsible for **empowering contributors**.

([[Leaders build Trust by being vulnerable, predictable, and celebrating the journey]]).

Our **Brand and Reputation** will ensure Our Company a defensible business model.
As well as our internal, confidential strategies (Investment Fund) AND relationships with big traditional economy players (Red Hat model in [[The Open Source business models]]).

#### Events

Our Company will organise Conventions, Conferences, and Hackathons.

We will do so in order to attract and identify the best Talents.

And also to enable the Open Market Ecosystem to grow.
The more the Open Market eats the world, the more we will benefit from it.

### The European Dream

The American Dream ended up constraining work and intellectual property.

We want to free both of them.

- Human Labour should be free.
- Intellectual Property should be free.

[[Open Source should always be Free]].

In opposition, we are building **The European Dream**.

#### European Strategy

[[Open source is a good strategy to disrupt busy markets]].
Google demonstrated this multiple times with Android and Kubernetes and others, and most recently Meta did it again with LLaMa2.

Europe rightly has strategic concerns about the Tech market being mostly controlled by private companies located in the United States of America.

As with any tech market, [[There's only one winner]]. And it's not Europe.

There's a good chance it won't ever be.

Therefore, disrupting the market leveraging Open Source sounds like a smart move.

**This will give Europe a chance to catch-up and start a new race.**

### Founding Team

[[I'm gonna be King of the Pirates]]

#### Pirate Crew

[[tBTCoE org chart]]

#### Pirate Ship Provider

In addition, the first Investors (in that case , [[VC funding]] makes the most sense), should also be considered a part of the Founding team.

- [Xavier Niel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Niel):  "Free" Founder. Visionary. Built [Station F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_F). We seem to share the same values and a similar mission.

- [Jack Dorsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey): "Twitter" and "Block" Founder. Visionary. Believes in a Free, Decentralised society. We seem to share similar values and ambitions.
