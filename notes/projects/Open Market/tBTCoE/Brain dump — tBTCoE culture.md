The European Dream



To employees: you are here because we want you to be here. we trust our hiring process and firing will never be the first option. over time, we must ensure that you and other employees all still want to work together and contribute to our latest mission.  
  
BELIEVE.THINK.BUILD  
  
  
A good sign is when we have to force you to close your laptop at 6pm.  
  
Write Notes then Write Opinions/Blogs.  
  
  
Values:  
We hired you because we know you're valuable, don't doubt it and don't fear diminishing it.  
Be (the best version of) yourself – no energy for hiding or faking  
Believe and don't let others make you doubt  
Communicate early, often, openly  
Commit: don't overcommit but be ambitious, alert if goals aren't going to be met, don't drop the ball  
Trust by default, but verify. Verifying is not a lack of trust. Vérifier != Micromanage.  
Know yourself and know others (MBTI?)  
Don't tolerate intolerance  
Don't blame (Non violent communication). How can you help? (Don't look back)  
Don't fear escalating, express your concerns: in general, try to bring solutions not just problems, but don't delay reporting an issue or concern only because you don't have a solution (is it your problem?)  
Open principles: TODO + read Jim's book: open objectives and results, schedule/calendars, messaging channels,  
No internal politics, No hidden interests. Politics is for new things: keep it for innovating.  
Hold others to our standards  
Diversity but close groups  
Learn and teach others  
Be healthy  
Happiness. Regular individual checkups: are we still a fit?. Is the employee-company relationship benefiting both sides?  
Freely express ideas but don't get attached to them, get attached to our company's mission.  
We're all 42yo, or rather age doesn't matter  
Don't assume. Ask.  
  
  
  
Some notes on companies practices:  
- Regular individual checks for alignment  
- OKRs: Objectives first  
- Remote work and free schedules are ok as long as they don't prevent meetings and regular in-person activities  
- Teams (squads) should be colocated (i.e. less than 2 hours traveling with a train): we will eventually cover costs for train travel.  
- Health and Work-Life balance come first. However, especially for employees with equity, it is important to understand that hard work is required to start something like what we're building. We're setting to do something hard and difficult, and you need to fully sign up for it. Have a life, but dedicate your work energy to our -your- mission.  
  
Cluster and reword with positive values. Use precise wording (use a dictionary, not GPT).  
Some of these are very generic and could be clustered together.  
  
  
Don't look back don't spend time on what's done.  
  
Tools  
- Google Workplace is great  
- GitHub is great / Gitlab is good  
- Trello is ok. Jira IDK.  
- Slack is great / Mattermost is ok (what about Revolt? (IM))  
- AirTable is great / Salesforce is good. Avoid spreadsheets.  
- Greenhouse is cool for hiring. Calendly is great for planning (Google Calendar sort of replaces it).  
- [https://appflowy.io/](https://appflowy.io/)  
  
- Automation before anything.  
- Pipelines solve it all.  
- You must have a place to document your product strategy, roadmap, and sales collateral.  
- Software is built to go to the trash, eventually.  
- Culture is here for Founders not to be in the room anymore when decisions are taken.  
  
Practices/rules? Cadre  
- Remote work?  
- Work time/day?  
- Location  
- Business reviews: pre announcements and results in front of exec leadership  
- Commercial reviews: deal/contractual reviews for non-obvious deals (all at first , then reproduce based on rules + precedent . If no rule + precedent, then CR required)

-> invite some "employees" to C-level meetings.


Au lieu de prendre 25% proposer un seuil au delà duquel on ne prend plus rien?  
Faire ideation des risques (eg difficulté d'emprunt) et trouver des solutions ( eg tBTCoE se porte caution , prête à taux 0, etc)  
Partenariats gov/SNCF/Europe/ trajets gratuits en Europe en train


SET also incentivised on portfolio? (Need to track per manager)  
Best teams have cash bonuses? (best team = best manager?)  
How to avoid focusing on short term outcomes?
