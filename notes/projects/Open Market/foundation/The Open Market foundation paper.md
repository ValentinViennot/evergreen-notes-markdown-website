# The Open Market: Reinventing Organizations in the Knowledge Economy


## Abstract

This paper examines the Open Market, a novel economic model designed for open source projects and intellectual properties. We analyze the core principles, mechanisms, and potential impacts of this model on value creation and investment dynamics, contrasting it with traditional economic systems. The Open Market challenges conventional notions of profitability, leveraging the non-rivalrous nature of intellectual property to foster a decentralized, liberal economy driven by utility defined as shared innovation, collaboration, and community benefits.


## 1. Introduction

The Open Market emerges in response to the evolving landscape of the digital economy, presenting a paradigm shift from the established economic framework.

Traditional capitalist frameworks are predominantly centered on tangible, rivalrous goods. Meanwhile, the Open Market is focused on knowledge-based, non-rivalrous goods.

The Open Market addresses the unique economic dynamics of non-rivalrous, open source projects, where the traditional scarcity-based value proposition does not apply. We believe that the misuse of intellectual property and labor as means of production in the current economy explains most of the observed inefficiencies such as capital accumulation, workers alienation, decrease of productivity, lack of maintenance of commons such as open-source foundations. We claim that innovation is currently inefficient and that open innovation is the solution. We observe that the lack of funding for open-source innovation comes from misaligned incentives.

The Open Market ambitions to implement an attractive, liberal and progressivist, economic system that aligns the incentives of consumers, investors, contributors, and projects organized in communities. We ground our ambitious assumptions in prior work and research, as well as facts and recent observations from the rise of decentralization and digitalization.

### 1.2 Fundamentals of world's current dominant economy

The current economy is a complex system where commodities, including tangible and intangible assets like stocks and equity, are traded based on supply and demand dynamics, with value determined by scarcity, utility, and market perceptions, and underpinned by currency that acts as a standard measure and store of value.

#### 1.2.1 Commodities

In the prevailing economic system, commodities, including stocks and equity, represent fundamental units of trade. These commodities are tangible or intangible assets traded on various markets, with their value driven by supply and demand dynamics. Stocks and equity, representing ownership stakes in corporations, exemplify how these assets can encapsulate not only present value but also the speculative future worth of an enterprise. This system hinges on the foundational concept of scarcity—the limited availability of goods—which confers value.

#### 1.2.2 Utility

Utility, in traditional economics, is a measure of the satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming goods or services. It forms the basis of the theory of consumer choice, influencing how resources are allocated in a market economy. Utility, therefore, is subjective and varies across individuals and contexts, shaping the demand side of the market.

#### 1.2.3 Value

The concept of value in conventional economics is multi-faceted, encompassing intrinsic value, market value, and perceived value. Intrinsic value refers to the inherent worth of a commodity based on its utility and resources involved in its production. Market value, however, is determined by the equilibrium in a market of supply and demand. Perceived value, on the other hand, extends beyond these factors, encompassing consumer perceptions, brand strength, and other intangible elements.

#### 1.2.4 Speculation

Speculation plays a critical role in the current economic system, driving investment decisions and market movements. Investors make (more or less) informed predictions about future market trends, investing in assets they believe will increase in value. While speculation contributes to market volatility, it also provides liquidity and can lead to efficient resource allocation, as it often reflects broader market sentiments and expectations.

#### 1.2.5 Currency

Currency, the medium of exchange in the economy, facilitates trade by providing a standard measure of value and a mechanism for storing wealth. Modern economies predominantly use fiat money, which derives its value not from physical properties or backing by a commodity but from the trust and credit of the economy.

### 1.3 The Knowledge Economy

> TODO: Write two or three paragraphs explaining in a few simple, logical, substantial sentences what is the "knowledge economy", what are its properties, how does it fundamentally differ from then traditional goods and services economy, and a little historical explanation (in particular around digitalization). In addition, mention the role and value of curation in a knowledge economy (and the theoretical abundance of knowledge).

### 1.4 Philosophical considerations

#### 1.4.1 Why do we work?

Work in human society is not solely for survival or economic necessity; it is also a pursuit of meaning, societal contribution, and personal fulfillment.

#### 1.4.2 Growth is not Progress

The traditional economic model often equates (financial) growth with progress. However, this paper distinguishes between these concepts, inspired by sustainable development principles and Raworth's Doughnut Economics [12]. We claim that 'progress' is qualitative improvements in knowledge, innovation capacity, and shared well-being, not quantitative 'growth'.

#### 1.4.3 The role of Money, Price, Value

Money is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Value however differs based on individual perceptions. Price comes as a consensus, an agreed fair exchange value.

#### 1.4.4 The value of Curation and Identity

Curation in the Open Market is a crucial mechanism for value creation. In the knowledge economy—in a world abundant in information and ideas—the act of selection and promotion of specific content or projects becomes invaluable. This process is tied to communal and individual identities, reflecting Bourdieu's social capital theory [4], where value is derived from networks of relationships and shared meanings.

### 1.5 Introduction to Curation Markets

The Curation Market model utilize bonding curves and tokenization to attribute value to intellectual contributions, acknowledging that the perceived value of intellectual property is a function of communal consensus. The Curation Market model was first proposed by S. De La Rouvière in 2017 [18]. The following sections summarize its functioning and core principles.

> TODO: Write a few subsections (use the white paper attached) to summarize the Curation Market white paper. This introduction explores how Curation Markets facilitate a more equitable and participatory economic model, aligning with Ostrom's principles of governing the commons, emphasizing collective stewardship.


## 2. Fundamentals of the Open Market model

### 2.1 Participants

#### 2.1.1 Consumers (Users)

The main participant in the Open Market model is the consumer. Utility can exist if and only if an exchange of value is ultimately providing satisfaction or benefit to an end consumer.

The consumer would usually be paying a certain price—trading value—for the received utility. This price could be paid with money or other valuables such as the user's attention, contribution, data, knowledge, etc. The paid price must always be clear to the consumer.

#### 2.1.2 Projects governance

In order to include all governance models and not require any specific one, we refer to the "Projects governance" as the organizing body or process in charge of making decisions. We acknowledge that the governance model might vary depending on the nature of the decision. For simplicity we will always refer to an unspecific "projects governance". Each project will adapt the proposed mechanisms to their specific governance situation.

The Open Market model does not require any relation between projects governance and the proposed economics. However, it is acknowledged that financial incentives might inevitably influence participants such as contributors and decision makers in the governance model.

#### 2.1.3 Contributors

Contributors include anyone contributing time (effort, skills, talent) to a specific project.

Contributors could be individuals or organizations.

Contributors should be making their contributions freely, out of interest and good will.

Examples of contributors could be developers, designers, authors, architects...

#### 2.1.4 Curators (Investors, Speculators)

The Open Market is designed as a Curation Market.

In the Open Market model, all participants are investors. Consumers are investing their money, Contributors are investing their time, and Projects (governance) are investing their influence.

Curators are equivalent to traditional investors. They invest money—capital—with a higher returns expectation (profit motive), **returned in the same form** (ie. money).

Curators may be referred to as 'Speculators'. However, speculation often implies a negative role (especially when defined as an ill-informed investment). Providing capital ahead of time in the hope of financial returns isn't necessarily a bad thing: in particular, speculation plays a systemic role of selection and promotion of specific content or projects. This is curation, hence 'Curators'.

Curators make an informed decision in selecting and investing their capital, ahead of time, in projects that—they expect—will provide increasing utility in the form of faster innovation. The Open Market is a race to the fastest innovation and Curators are betting on the winners.

### 2.2 Non-rivalrous goods in the knowledge economy

Open source projects exemplify non-rivalrous goods in the digital—knowledge—economy, characterized by their capacity for unlimited replication at marginal cost. This property contrasts with the diminishing returns associated with the production of rivalrous goods in conventional markets.

### 2.3 Tokenization

Tokens are uniquely tied to the project's utility and communal value representing a share in the future investment and innovation capacity of a project. We believe that this capacity equals the shared brand value.

## 3. Principles

### 3.1 Profitability beyond financial gains

Profitability extends beyond financial returns. We emphasize the enhancement of collective capabilities as a measure of economic success.

### 3.2 Maximizing utility (Decentralized economic ecosystem)

The Open Market recognizes the collective effort of communities as the central value creation mechanism, where decentralized participants contribute more efficiently than traditional hierarchical organizations. **The outcome of the Open Market is to maximize the utility derived from the time and money invested in open source communities by contributors and curators.**

We believe that decentralized knowledge utilization is much more efficient and enables more responsive and dynamic innovation processes.

### 3.3 Speculative nature of investments

Speculative investments—as financial investments based on the anticipated future utility of projects—are driving economic evolution and growth. We embrace the role of speculations in fast-faced progressivists free economies.


## 4. Brand Value and Incentives

### 4.1 Brand Equity

In the Open Market, brand equity of open source projects is quantified through the community's engagement and contributions. Unlike traditional brand equity, which is often tied to consumer perception and marketing, in the Open Market, brand equity is a direct measure of a project's health and activity level. It reflects the community's trust and reliance on the project, which is crucial for open source initiatives where success hinges on active participation and collaboration.

### 4.2 Brand Equity Tokens (BETs) as Economic Instruments

Brand Equity Tokens (BETs) are the tangible representation of a project’s brand equity in the Open Market. Their value is directly linked to the project's performance and community engagement. For instance, a BET in a highly collaborative and widely used open-source project would have greater value than one in a lesser-known project. The value of BETs fluctuates based on real-time community contributions, usage metrics, and overall project health.

### 4.3 Bonding Curves: Mechanism and Function

The bonding curve is a mathematical formula that determines the price of BETs based on their current supply. As more BETs are issued (bought), the price per token increases, following the curve. This model creates an economic incentive for early contributors, as early investment in a project will cost less and potentially yield higher returns as the project grows. Conversely, as tokens are sold, the price decreases, following the curve downward.

### 4.4 Curation Markets: Principles and Functioning

Curation Markets are a decentralized approach to value assessment in the Open Market. In these markets, participants use BETs to vote on or endorse projects they believe are valuable. This system democratically determines a project's worth based on community consensus rather than centralized decision-making. It aligns with Ostrom's principles for managing commons by incentivizing contributors to act in the best interest of the community, ensuring the sustainability and growth of the open source project.

### 4.5 Participants and Their Roles

- **Creators**: Initiate projects and are pivotal in setting the vision and roadmap.
- **Contributors**: Enhance the project’s value through code contributions, bug fixes, and feature developments. Their contributions directly impact the project's brand equity.
- **Investors**: Purchase BETs, providing capital influx. They speculate on the project's future success based on current and potential community engagement.
- **Users**: Utilize the project and provide feedback, contributing to the project's reputation and, indirectly, its brand equity.

### 4.6 Solving the Commons Funding Problem

The Open Market model addresses the classic problem in managing commons (as detailed by Ostrom) by creating direct financial incentives for contributors. By tying the financial gains of BETs to the success and health of an open source project, the model ensures that those who contribute to the commons are rewarded proportionally. This approach encourages ongoing maintenance and innovation in open source projects, overcoming the traditional funding and incentive challenges faced by commons.

> TODO detail in alignment with Ostrom's theory and how it fulfils the conditions she identified as critical for governing the commons.
> TODO: clarify in what sense does the Open Market model create a joint incentive for participants who will benefit from the final outcome but alone wouldn't be incentivised to fund it (here the market gives a transparent signal and the sum being bigger than the parts it's incentivised and encouraged to join forces).
> TODO: draw a parallel with the crowdfunding model and incentives, and show how the Open Market can in addition integrate with crowdfunding models, making it even stronger

### 4.7 Practical Application: A Case Study

Consider an open source software tool for data analysis. As the tool gains popularity and usage, the community's contributions increase, enhancing the tool's functionality. Early contributors, who received BETs when the tool was less known, benefit from the increased value of their tokens as the tool becomes integral to the data science community. New contributors are incentivized not only by the potential financial returns from BETs but also by being part of a successful, impactful project.

## 5. Market Dynamics and Stability

### 5.1 Transparent and Fair Market Governance

The Open Market's emphasis on transparent market governance aligns with Stiglitz’s critique of information asymmetry, advocating for transparency to ensure fairness and efficiency.

### 5.2 Liquidity and Market Efficiency

Liquidity in the Open Market, facilitated by speculative investments, is critical for efficient market functioning. Keynes’s liquidity preference theory provides foundational understanding of the role of liquidity in financial markets.

## 6. Utility as the Basis of Value in the Open Market

Utility in the Open Market is defined by the project's adaptability, innovativeness, and community strength. This definition aligns with Becker's theory on the allocation of time, emphasizing non-monetary factors in determining value.

## 7. Integration with Traditional Economic Models

### 7.1 Complementarity with Existing Economic Systems

The Open Market complements traditional economic models, particularly in sectors dominated by non-rivalrous goods. This approach is akin to the concept of mixed economies, combining different economic systems for optimal outcomes.

### 7.2 Applicability Across Economic Sectors

The application of the Open Market across various sectors demonstrates its versatility, with case studies in software development, digital content creation, and collaborative research illustrating its practical implementation.

## 8. Conclusion and Future directions

The Open Market Model offers a viable complement to traditional economic frameworks, particularly suited for the digital and knowledge-based economy. Its focus on immaterial, innovation-led growth, driven by mass retail investments, presents a transformative approach to how we innovate and create value. Future research should explore the implementation challenges and long-term sustainability of this model.

### 8.1 Future work: the Open Market Foundation and Protocol

We propose the creation of the Open Market Foundation and community work on the Open Market Protocol. We recommend the implementation as federated Open Market Exchanges implementing the protocol and subscribed as members of the Foundation. They will protect and defend their listed project's licenses and IP and enforce the market rules. It is envisioned that they could also create debt, guaranteeing the liquidity of the market and its connection to the main traditionally cash-powered economy (or any other economy, such as crypto). 

### 8.2 Differentiating from speculative crypto bubbles

The Open Market, while coinciding with the era of cryptocurrencies, differentiates
The rise of the Open Market coincides with an era marked by the proliferation of cryptocurrencies and associated speculative bubbles. However, the Open Market fundamentally differentiates itself from these phenomena through several key aspects:

#### 8.2.1 Rooted in Real Utility and Community Value

Unlike many speculative crypto ventures driven by market hype and short-term gains, the Open Market is anchored in the real utility of open source projects. The value of tokens in the Open Market is intrinsically linked to the tangible utility, adaptability, and communal contribution of the projects they represent. This focus on real-world applicability and innovation ensures that the market dynamics are grounded in actual substance rather than mere speculation.

#### 8.2.2 Sustainable Economic Framework

Speculative crypto bubbles often lack a sustainable economic model, leading to volatile booms and busts. In contrast, the Open Market is designed as a sustainable economic ecosystem, where growth is driven by long-term communal innovation and participation. This sustainability is achieved through governance structures that prioritize equitable distribution of value and mechanisms like bonding curves, which ensure a more stable and predictable market evolution.

#### 8.2.3 Transparency and Regulatory Compliance

The Open Market advocates for high levels of transparency and adherence to regulatory standards. This contrasts with the opacity often seen in speculative crypto markets, where lack of transparency and regulatory oversight can lead to manipulation and fraud. In the Open Market, clear information disclosure, adherence to legal frameworks, and ethical practices are fundamental, building trust and stability in the market. We promote a centralized decentralized approach. Fundamentally decentralized with the emergence of regulatory hyperstructures. We however advocate for a transparent, open, accessible protocol. Anyone could decide to copy and run their own protocol and, if we agree on the regulatory terms, even join the Open Market network. We propose non-profit foundation, the Open Market Foundation, as the higest regulatory body.

#### 8.2.4 Diversification of Investment and Risk

In the Open Market, investment and risk are diversified across a wide range of projects and contributions. Unlike speculative crypto investments, which often hinge on the success of a single currency or platform, the Open Market distributes risk through a portfolio of diverse open source projects. This diversification not only mitigates risk but also promotes a broader scope of innovation and development.
