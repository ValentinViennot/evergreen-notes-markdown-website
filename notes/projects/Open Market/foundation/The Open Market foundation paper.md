# The Open Market: reinventing organizations in the knowledge economy

## Abstract

This paper examines the Open Market Economy, a novel economic system tailored to open source projects and intellectual properties. We analyze the core principles, mechanisms, and potential impacts of this model on value creation and investment dynamics, contrasting it with traditional economic systems. The Open Market challenges conventional notions of profitability, leveraging the non-rivalrous nature of intellectual property to foster an economy driven by shared innovation, collaboration, and community benefits.

## 1. Introduction

The Open Market emerges in response to the evolving landscape of the digital economy, presenting a paradigm shift from the established economic framework.

Traditional capitalist frameworks are predominantly centered on tangible, rivalrous goods. Meanwhile, the Open Market is focused on knowledge-based, non-rivalrous goods. The Open Market adresses the unique economic dynamics of non-rivalrous, open source projects, where the traditional scarcity-based value proposition does not apply.

To comprehend its significance and innovation, it is essential first to understand the fundamentals of the current economic system.

### 1.1 Fundamentals of world's current dominant economy

> TODO: short, accessible intro combining the following concepts and how they combine in the everyday life of all of us

#### 1.1.1 Commodities

In the prevailing economic system, commodities, including stocks and equity, represent fundamental units of trade. These commodities are tangible or intangible assets traded on various markets, with their value driven by supply and demand dynamics. Stocks and equity, representing ownership stakes in corporations, exemplify how these assets can encapsulate not only present value but also the speculative future worth of an enterprise. This system hinges on the foundational concept of scarcity — the limited availability of goods, which confers value.

#### 1.1.2 Utility

Utility, in traditional economics, is a measure of the satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming goods or services. It forms the basis of the theory of consumer choice, influencing how resources are allocated in a market economy. Utility, therefore, is subjective and varies across individuals and contexts, shaping the demand side of the market.

#### 1.1.3 Value

The concept of value in conventional economics is multi-faceted, encompassing intrinsic value, market value, and perceived value. Intrinsic value refers to the inherent worth of a commodity based on its utility and resources involved in its production. Market value, however, is determined by the equilibrium in a market of supply and demand. Perceived value, on the other hand, extends beyond these factors, encompassing consumer perceptions, brand strength, and other intangible elements.

#### 1.1.4 Speculation

Speculation plays a critical role in the current economic system, driving investment decisions and market movements. Speculators make informed predictions about future market trends, investing in assets they believe will increase in value. While speculation can contribute to market volatility, it also provides liquidity and can lead to efficient resource allocation, as it often reflects broader market sentiments and expectations.

#### 1.1.5 Currency

Currency, the medium of exchange in the economy, facilitates trade by providing a standard measure of value and a mechanism for storing wealth. Modern economies predominantly use fiat money, which derives its value not from physical properties or backing by a commodity but from the trust and credit of the economy.

### 1.2 Philosophic Considerations

> TODO: without losing the substance, make these subsections shorter. 

#### 1.2.1 Why do we work?

The motivation behind work in human society transcends mere survival and economic necessity. It intertwines with our pursuit of meaning, societal contribution, and personal fulfillment. This perspective is anchored in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where self-actualization stands at the apex. In the context of the Open Market, work is reimagined not just as a means to an end but as an integral part of personal and communal development, aligning with Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow, where engagement in work becomes intrinsically rewarding.

#### 1.2.2 Growth is not progress

The traditional economic model often conflates growth with progress, equating increased production and consumption with societal advancement. However, this paper argues for a delineation between these concepts, drawing on the principles of sustainable development and the Doughnut Economics model proposed by Raworth (2017). In the Open Market, progress is measured not by quantitative growth but by qualitative improvements in communal knowledge, innovation capacity, and shared well-being.

#### 1.2.3 The role of money, price, value

Money, in traditional economics, is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. However, its role in the Open Market transitions from being the central pivot of transactions to a facilitator of value exchange within a broader context of communal contribution and innovation. Price in this model becomes a dynamic reflection of communal valuation rather than just market demand, resonating with Polanyi's concept of the substantivist economy, where socio-cultural factors influence economic behavior.

#### 1.2.4 The value of curation and identity

In the Open Market, curation emerges as a key mechanism for value creation, recognizing that in a world abundant in information and ideas, the act of selection, endorsement, and promotion of specific content or projects becomes invaluable. This process is closely tied to the construction of communal and individual identities, reflecting Bourdieu's theory of social capital, where value is derived from networks of relationships and shared meanings.

### 1.3 Introduction to Curation Markets

Curation Markets represent a foundational component of the Open Market Model, providing a structure for managing and monetizing intellectual contributions in a way that traditional markets for physical goods cannot. They utilize unique mechanisms such as bonding curves and tokenization to attribute value to contributions. These markets draw on the principles of behavioral economics, acknowledging that the perceived value of intellectual property is influenced by communal consensus and the shared belief in the project's potential. This introduction will delve into the mechanics of Curation Markets, exploring how they facilitate a more equitable and participatory economic model, aligning with Ostrom's principles of governing the commons, where community-managed resources thrive under collective stewardship.

## 2. Fundamentals of the Open Market Model

### 2.1. Non-Rivalrous Goods in the Digital Economy

Open source projects exemplify non-rivalrous goods, characterized by their capacity for unlimited replication at marginal cost (Coase, 1974). This property starkly contrasts with the diminishing returns associated with the production of rivalrous goods in conventional markets.

### 2.2. Community-Driven Value Creation

The Open Market recognizes the collective effort of communities as a central value creation mechanism. This approach draws from Benkler's (2006) analysis of networked information economy, where decentralized participants collectively contribute more efficiently than traditional hierarchical organizations.

### 2.3. Decentralized Economic Ecosystem

The decentralization principle in the Open Market echoes Hayek's (1945) emphasis on the efficiency of decentralized knowledge utilization in economies, enabling more responsive and dynamic innovation processes.

## 3. Principles of Value and Profit in the Open Market Model

### 3.1. Profitability Beyond Financial Gains

In the OM, profitability extends beyond mere financial returns, encompassing the communal and societal benefits derived from open source projects. This concept resonates with Sen's (1999) Capability Approach, emphasizing the enhancement of collective capabilities as a measure of economic success.

### 3.2. Speculative Nature of Investments

Speculation in the OM, akin to traditional markets, is rooted in the anticipated future utility of projects. Schumpeter's (1942) theory of entrepreneurial innovation underscores the role of speculative investments in driving economic evolution and growth.

### 3.3. Tokenization as Value Representation

The use of tokens in the Open Market for representing stakes in projects borrows from the concept of securitization in financial markets. These tokens, however, are uniquely tied to the project's utility and communal value, aligning with the concept of utility maximization in neoclassical economics.

## 4. Market Dynamics and Stability

> TODO: there lacks a section explaining the function of the open market: brand value, brand equity, brand equity tokens, and how it ties to underlying utility and what incentives does it create for investors, consumers, contributors, projects. All these concepts should first be introduced in an accessible manner and then detailed and related.

### 4.1. Transparent and Fair Market Governance

The OM's emphasis on transparent market governance aligns with Stiglitz’s (2002) critique of information asymmetry in markets, advocating for transparency to ensure fairness and efficiency.

### 4.2. Liquidity and Market Efficiency

Liquidity in the OM, facilitated by speculative investments, is critical for efficient market functioning. Keynes’s (1936) liquidity preference theory provides a foundational understanding of the role of liquidity in financial markets.

## 5. Utility as the Basis of Value in the Open Market

### 5.1. Defining Utility in Open Source Projects

Utility in the Open Market is defined by the project's adaptability, innovativeness, and community strength. This definition aligns with Becker's (1962) theory on the allocation of time, emphasizing the role of non-monetary factors in determining value.

## 6. Integration with Traditional Economic Models

### 6.1. Complementarity with Existing Economic Systems

The Open Market does not seek to replace traditional economic models but rather complements them, especially in sectors dominated by non-rivalrous goods. This approach is akin to the concept of mixed economies (Samuelson, 1955), which combine different economic systems for optimal outcomes.

### 6.2. Applicability Across Economic Sectors

The application of Open Market across various sectors demonstrates its versatility. Case studies in sectors like software development, digital content creation, and collaborative research illustrate its practical implementation.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Directions

The Open Market Model offers a viable complement to traditional economic frameworks, particularly suited for the digital and knowledge-based economy. Its focus on immaterial, innovation-led growth, driven by mass retail investments, presents a transformative approach to how we innovate and create value. Future research should explore the implementation challenges and long-term sustainability of this model.

> TODO: add a section on future work where we suggest the creation of the Open Market Foundation and community work on the Open Market Protocol. We recommend the implementation as federated Open Market Exchanges implementing the protocol and subscribed as members of the Foundation. They will protect and defends their listed project's licences and IP as well as enforce the rules of the market. It is envisioned that they could also be entitled to creating debt as their mission will be to guarantee the liquidity of the market and its connection to the main traditionally cash-powered economy (or any other economy, such as crypto). 

### 7.1 Differentiating from Speculative Crypto Bubbles

The rise of the Open Market coincides with an era marked by the proliferation of cryptocurrencies and associated speculative bubbles. However, the Open Market fundamentally differentiates itself from these phenomena through several key aspects:

#### 7.1.1 Rooted in Real Utility and Community Value

Unlike many speculative crypto ventures driven by market hype and short-term gains, the Open Market is anchored in the real utility of open source projects. The value of tokens in the Open Market is intrinsically linked to the tangible utility, adaptability, and communal contribution of the projects they represent. This focus on real-world applicability and innovation ensures that the market dynamics are grounded in actual substance rather than mere speculation.

#### 7.1.2 Sustainable Economic Framework

Speculative crypto bubbles often lack a sustainable economic model, leading to volatile booms and busts. In contrast, the Open Market is designed as a sustainable economic ecosystem, where growth is driven by long-term communal innovation and participation. This sustainability is achieved through governance structures that prioritize equitable distribution of value and mechanisms like bonding curves, which ensure a more stable and predictable market evolution.

#### 7.1.3 Transparency and Regulatory Compliance

The Open Market advocates for high levels of transparency and adherence to regulatory standards. This contrasts with the opacity often seen in speculative crypto markets, where lack of transparency and regulatory oversight can lead to manipulation and fraud. In the Open Market, clear information disclosure, adherence to legal frameworks, and ethical practices are fundamental, building trust and stability in the market. We promote a centralized decentralized approach. Fundamentally decentralized with the emergence of regulatory hyperstructures. We however advocate for a transparent, open, accessible protocol. Anyone could decide to copy and run their own protocol and, if we agree on the regulatory terms, even join the Open Market network. We propose non-profit foundation, the Open Market Foundation, as the higest regulatory body.

#### 7.1.5 Diversification of Investment and Risk

In the Open Market, investment and risk are diversified across a wide range of projects and contributions. Unlike speculative crypto investments, which often hinge on the success of a single currency or platform, the Open Market distributes risk through a portfolio of diverse open source projects. This diversification not only mitigates risk but also promotes a broader scope of innovation and development.
