TODO: Rewrite based on [[The Open Market foundation paper]] and [[OM white paper]] and [[fuckthevcs.com - Manifesto]]. Make it shorter. Get inspired by the Obsidian manifesto. Make it more positive and long term focused and about values. The rebellious aspect is left to the fuckthevcs.com movement.



Our intention with the "Open Market" is to create an alternative economic system that prioritises collaboration, societal impact, and meaningful work over profit-driven motives.

In this system:

1. **Labor** is valued for its creative and productive contributions.
2. **Value** is determined by the positive impact on society and collective well-being.
3. **Currency** incentivises collaboration and innovation, rather than profit-seeking.
4. **Capital** equals financial and intellectual resources, used to invest in projects.
5. **Market** dynamics shift to open competition aimed at achieving common goals.
6. **Investment** serves resource allocation for projects aligned with the collective vision.
7. **Labor-Capital relationship** evolves into a collaborative, equitable partnership.
8. **Ownership** is redefined as shared ownership of outcomes, social property.

Our goal is to build a system that challenges the limitations of traditional capitalism: a more equitable, value-driven, and collaborative economic paradigm.

We believe our way of working must change and **is already** changing. Younger generations and more educated workers aim to find immediate meaning in their labor. They want to contribute not to private profits but in things they believe in and support.

Society is ready to hear and welcome a new, more equitable story that values great work more than financial gains. Our short-term profits-led economic system has created issues that turned into global challenges: climate change, inequalities, political polarisation... Younger generations want to end this system that they did not create. They understand we won't overcome these challenges without a change in the way society operates.

It will be hard as it will require multiple difficult paradigm and cultural shifts. It also has to happen within the systemic rules and boundaries of the status quo (capitalism).
Many have tried to change the system but often from a political perspective and wanting to revolutionise all things. We don't believe in this anymore. We believe we have to change it _from inside_. We have to be great players in the game, until we win it over.

And this change has to come from the ones creating value: the workers, human labor.
In particular, We believe that tech workers —mostly engineers— are (still) in a unique position that would enable them to initiate these changes. They have true, uncommodified labor power, something that usually doesn't last for long in our economic system.

We need to re-think "work", "value", "capital", "profit", "markets", "investment"...

Tech idealists have already popularised what shouldn't exist in a capitalist economy: Free Software, Open Source. They give away human labor for free. They don't seek profit. Why? Because they are believers, in a cause or a vision. In a philosophy. Because they want to do great work. Because they seek meaning in their work.

The tech industry has already pushed forward our society many times, and in particular our way of working: remote work, lean management, unlimited paid leave or the 4-day week... 

Open source should not exist in a capitalist economy because it has no added value.
By definition, it must be _Free_. Originally **free** as in **free**dom, but—as a consequence—also as in **free** beer. The two of them are bound together. A consequence is that open-source projects and companies usually have a hard time making profits. Have you ever tried selling something that is _free_? That's really hard. But not impossible.

Open source has the biggest added value to society. It creates healthy, unrestricted, and fast competition. It gives meaning to project contributors, directly connecting them with the results of their labor. It removes alienation. It encourages new, innovative projects. It fosters communities. It opens resources that have no valid motives to be close or private.

Capitalism defines intellectual property and human labor as production means. This system is broken. Machines, factories, materials, energy can be commodified production means. But human labor and knowledge shouldn't be commodified.

Enterprises, corporations are human constructs.
They are stories designed to serve **Us**.
Not the opposite.

Many open-source projects and companies today are results of ill-motivated strategies. Because these projects are by-design not directly profitable in the current economy, the return on investment is always intricate. The investment motivations are hidden behind an openness or a 'for good' message. Incentives are misaligned.

There is no systemic positive investment loop for open-source projects: in fact, it's the opposite. Open source is a great way to disrupt and win over a market. But the metric is, and will always be, private profits that will eventually encourage close-source innovation.

We lack an open source business model.
Or rather, an open source **economy**.

A creators economy that systematically incentivises:

- Great work
- Collective innovation
- Decentralised investment
- Growth as perpetual progress

This new economy must be compatible with the status quo. In fact this new economy should be _designed_ to win the current economy game. This game can be hacked. There is a way to accumulate all available capital. It's like a giant _Monopoly_ game (although, hopefully, in _Monopoly_ you can't create debt —otherwise the game would be endless.)

Our new economy is a hack of the system.

Our new economy sees human labor as an investment.
Our new economy requires innovation to be free, open-source.
Our new economy is fast growing, and demands continuous progress.
Our new economy directly connects workers with the products they build.
Our new economy allows for individual profits, but optimises for collective value.
Our new economy involves contributors, investors, and users on the same levels.
Our new economy creates and captures value in order to allocate it to new projects.

Our new economy refuses alienation.
Our new economy prevents capital accumulation.

**We believe this new economy is ready to happen. We just need to build it.**

Our intuition is that creating this economy is **equivalent** to solving open source's lack of a profitable business model (or rather, lack of sustainable investment).

**That's what the Open Market does.**

The Open Market redesigns open-source projects funding considering their nature of being _free_, for open source contributors to be _paid_ and users to get the most _value_.

I'm moving **fast**. Right now, I need:
