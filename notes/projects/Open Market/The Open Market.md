**The Open Market is a new economy to sustainably invest in Open Source**.

The Open Market aims to enable humans to innovate a lot more efficiently
by building a distributed world of happy, fairly compensated workers.

The Open Market envisions building an economic and financial subsystem, a [Curation Market](https://medium.com/@simondlr/introducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881) based on Decentralised Finance tech. This new Open Market will serve as the financial infrastructure for Open Source funding. The Open Market creates a new marketplace within the bigger economic system, with a different paradigm and different incentives. 

The Open Market is designed to improve Capitalism.
