**Assumptions on which [[The Open Market]] depends.**

Assumptions are beliefs or ideas we believe to be true.
They are not as factual as the [[Open Market Postulates]].

Assumptions are not tested or proven; they are simply the things we believe to be true before we begin our research or analysis.

Our goal should be to debunk or validate all of them as we move forward.
We will propose [[Open Market Hypothesis]] in order to validate them.
A validated (proven) assumption would then become an [[Open Market Postulates]].

Of course we won't be able to test and validate all of them at once.
Therefore, we must prioritise the ones representing the biggest risk.
Or, rather, offering the biggest opportunity for learning. 

**We will try to keep our Assumptions as safe as possible.**

_[[TODO]] / WIP_

- [[The changing way of working]]
- [[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]]
	- AND, much more efficient
- [[Happy workers are better workers]]
- [[Open Source is not profitable]] —TODO: Need to write down [[Why is Open Source not profitable? (Essay)]] based only on [[Open Market Postulates]] — already added to Postulates, but would be better to gather more solid proof that this is indeed the case, and why
- [[Nothing can compete with Open Source]] (funded)
- [[Human Labour is what creates Value]]
- Being a good capitalist player comes from:
	- Steadily or exponentially increasing revenue
	- Attracting always more investors
- Rules limit efficiency of a company ([[No rules rules]])
- Open Sourcing all tech will disrupt tech market and remove existing monopolies
- Europe regulators will find this idea strategic and to their advantage
