A [[Brand Equity]] token is the main asset traded in [[Open Market Economy]].

It is a [[Smart or Liquid Token]] representing a share in an open source project's [[Brand Equity]].
It estimates the future [[Brand Value]] of an open-source project.

Brand Equity Token (BET) can only be created (purchased) or destroyed (sold).
BETs can't be directly exchanged.
"Trading" a BET effectively means destroying and then re-creating it.

The purchase/sell value of BET is directly obtained with a mathematical formula: [[BET value formula]]. This ensures permanent liquidity yet still reflecting the offer & demand dynamics, and ensuring a transparent logic behind a token price.

Purchasing BETs can happen for mainly two reasons:

1. Funding a development (eg. paying a contributor / placing a bounty)
2. Investing in the BET future value

[[TODO]]:
- Open Market Bonding/Cost Curve
- Look closer at [[Open Market references]] (in particular https://radicle.xyz/), 
	- And see how what I do becomes their infrastructure
