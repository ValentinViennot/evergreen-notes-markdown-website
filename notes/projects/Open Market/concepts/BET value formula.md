[[Brand Equity Token (OM)]]s (BETs) forecast estimated future [[Brand Value]].
BETs materialise open-source projects' [[Brand Equity]].

The BET value (price) should reflect the market sentiment on the amount of future investment that will go into a specific Brand (project).

We use a [Bonding Curve](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/) in order to guarantee the following advantages:

- Limitless supply
- Deterministic price
- Continuous price
- Instant liquidity

`price = .003*X` with `X` being the number of tokens in circulation.
