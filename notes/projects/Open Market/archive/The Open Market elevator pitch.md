_(What's an [[Elevator pitch]]?)_


- Innovation issue
	- Problem for consumers
	- Problem for governments
	- Problem for non-monopoly enterprises
- **Open source (as in, free software) as the solution**
- Problem: open source isn't profitable
	- "Problem" for monopoly enterprises
	- Problem for FLOSS projects and contributors
- Two ways: Services and Brand leverage
- BUT: inefficient, illiquid over-the-counter market
	- & fundamentally incompatible with current economic axioms
		- As IP and work of contributors cannot be free in current economy
- How to solve? **Create a parallel Open Source Economy with different axioms**
	- Mission: Align various incentives through a Brand Curation Market
	- How? **Trading Open Source Brand Equity**
		- Commodity that, by-design, **estimates future investment**
			- Price is based on market-sentiment of future investment
				- **Ability of a project to attract more or less contributions,**
					- (Preferably paid ones)
		- In other words, trading the future of innovation
			- **The ability of projects to innovate faster than others.**
				- It's a race to innovation incentivised by financial instruments
					- **It's the stock market with fundamentally different axioms**
						- Not only compatible with open source
						- But making open source a system requirement
						- If a project isn't open source, it'll be less attractive
		- But, why would consumers pay? In exchange for either work or money
			- Under this idea, someone could approach a project and say "I have an issue and this is how much I'm willing to pay - in a share - to get that fixed."  —In fact, they wouldn't need to approach them but only to create the market incentives by putting high stakes on the table.
			- **A corollary is the equivalent to Index funds today**
				- Maybe not a specific feature request or need to be solved
					- But rather 'I depend on that and I have an incentive to maintain'
						- Eg, LF or CNCF could be Index Funds on this market
				- Incentive is both practical
					- As they depend on the software
				- And economic,
					- As they would own shares in the Index fund
			- Contributors would be the equivalent to share-holders,
				- Although, here, holding a share doesn't give you a right to vote.
					- It's essential that the project's governance is free
						- Free to organise and innovate as they see fit
							- The market would only create the $ incentives
				- Investing, either time or money, becomes a bet on a project's future
					- With clear rules —instruments— that can explain past events,
					- And a way to influence the market —contributing to projects,
					- + not _just_ speculative, as **real-world value is created**,
		- **Contributors, investors, and leaders of the projects would be more aligned on future value including governance and quality of contributions.**
- So, what?
	- Create the market infrastructure: Curation Market Tokenising OSS Brand Equity
		- **Non-profit Foundation to Govern and Regulate**
		- **Brand Equity Exchange Places and APIs, Compliant with Regulations**
		- Automated Market Makers Ensuring Brand Equity Liquidity
	- How do I make profit? **The first FLOSS Venture Capital Fund!**
		- Invest cash on open source projects that we think will attract $ contributions
		- Develop alternative to close source, proprietary solutions and market them
		- Incubate new or existing OSS projects
	- Starting Point
		- Big Tech, Medium-to-small-sized company with a Crowdfunding approach
		- EU governments and Institutions with a tech sovereignty concern
		- Move the funds from them to the projects, through these market incentives
- From my past discussions, there's a lot to be defined, but it feels like
	- **There's a huge untapped potential market**
	- And participants waiting for someone to materialise it
	- Suffering? **EU governments, OSS projects, Security & Maintenance issues**
		- And to some extent, consumers, but they don't realise it _yet_
		- 
- ->ALIGN INCENTIVES WITH AN OPEN INNOVATION VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET

**We're going to build [[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]].**


IT spendings were something like $4.7 trillion in 2023, and increasing.

Yet, innovation is so slow and inefficient in most companies.
In fact, we believe that most of these resources are being wasted.

We have a plan to optimise and win over any competitor on our way.


How? We're going to build and rebuild everything Open Source.

[[Nothing can compete with Open Source]]
It will always be the cheapest most innovative most adaptable solution out there.
And Open Source is undeniably the most resource efficient way to build software.

The only problem is that Open Source wasn't profitable.

Until now.


We've built a platform that makes Open Source a profitable investment.

In fact, our solution provides a way to sustainably grow Open Source projects.

We've called it the Open Market.

And we need YOU to get started.


Do you have an hour to talk about it?
