([[Elevator pitch]])


**We're going to build the biggest tech company on earth.**


IT spendings were something like $4.7 trillion in 2023, and increasing.

Yet, innovation is so slow and inefficient in most companies.
In fact, we believe that most of these resources are being wasted.

We have a plan to optimise and win over any competitor on our way.


How? We're going to build and rebuild everything Open Source.

Nothing can compete with Open Source.
It will always be the cheapest most innovative most adaptable solution out there.
And Open Source is undeniably the most resource efficient way to build software.

The only problem is that Open Source wasn't profitable.

Until now.


We've built a platform that makes Open Source a profitable investment.

In fact, our solution provides a way to sustainably grow Open Source projects.

We've called it the Open Market.

And we need YOU to get started.


Do you have an hour to talk about it?
