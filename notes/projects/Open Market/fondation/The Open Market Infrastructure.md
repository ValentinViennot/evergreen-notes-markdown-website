[[The Open Market]] defines a new Economy based on the [[Open Market Axioms]].
Its real-world implementation would happen through the open [[Open Market Protocol]] under the governance of an independent, non-profit [[Open Market Fondation]]. [[Open Market Exchange]] places would run the Protocol and constitute the infrastructure.

[[The Open Market Infrastructure]] is the financial system bringing this economy to life.
It is a [[Curation Market]] to fund and invest in open-source projects' [[Brand Equity]].

[[Brand Value]] can be defined as a project's identity resulting of the project's governance decisions and the quality of the R&D work delivered by its many contributors.

Leveraging [[Brand Value]] (through [[Brand Equity]]) is a common way for open-source projects to create commercial value ([[The Open Source business models]]). [[The Open Market Economy]] proposes a systemic open-source [[Brand Value]] valuation methodology based on market mechanisms in order to align investors, open-source projects, contributors, and consumers ' interests through powerful, systemic market incentives.

1. [[Brand Equity]] ownership is organised through the sale of [[Brand Equity Token (OM)]]
2. [[Brand Equity Token (OM)]] are sold using an automated market-maker ([[Open Market Protocol]]) utilising a [[Bonding Curve]] ([[Curation Market]]) with increasing token value.
3. The token price is continuous and tokens can always get created or destroyed.
4. Tokens creations and destructions provide a market estimate of [[Brand Equity]] (#1)
5. Consumers and investors can buy [[Brand Equity Token (OM)]] to reward contributors in order to incentivise open-source projects' sustainability and development. As such, a project's R&D costs are by-design taken care of. There's no other costs. (#2)
6. Project governance is organised independently. Tokens don't give voting rights.
7. Contributors are free to work and get rewarded with shares of the Brands they built.
8. They can diversify their investments by contributing to various projects and maturity.
9. Contributors can then decide when to destroy (sell) their tokens in order to cash out.
10. By default, the Open Market is a zero-sum game. It's just a transaction mean. (#3)
11. Yet, different [[Bonding Curve]]s can get used to set the create vs destroy (buy vs sell) prices. Experimenting with parameters is required and some rules/boundaries should be defined. However, provided this information is always public and that any change is communicated in advance to investors, the market would be able to play a curation role in finding the best equilibrium parameters. In fact, using different [[Bonding Curve]] creates a 'vesting' incentive as investors wouldn't be able to immediately cash out without making a loss. This encourages long-term investments and creates an opportunity for a second-hand market to exist.
12. In addition, _curators_ ("speculators") are allowed to enter the market (after demonstrating their understanding of these new financial instruments and proving their identity). As [[Curation Market]] enable the merge of first-hand and second-hand markets, the impact of _curators_ is to provide liquidity by seeking profit. (#4)
13. In [[The Open Market Economy]], _Value_ is defined as the instant cost of IP creation. To some extent, this allows some comparison with the Energy Market.
14. Projects would now be financially incentivised to continuously keep innovating and attract more and more contributions with competitive, quality products and efficient governance models. (see scenarios in #5)
15. Because the 'free' nature of Work and Intellectual Property (IP, knowledge) is axiomatic to the Open Market design and definitions ([[Open Market Axioms]]), we can conclude that the outcome of the Open Market will be to **free innovation**.

Note that [[The Open Market]] doesn't replace the need for projects' monetisation. However, it incentivises all innovation to be open and cover for the costs of R&D. Open-source projects would now fairly compete with close-source innovation and face the same, much less problematic (#2), monetisation challenges. [[The Open Market Infrastructure]] will enable many new models such as integrating B2C feature-level crowdfunding ([[Open Market APIs Project Ideas]]). [[The Open Market]] proposal effectively turns Open Source Brands into a Commodity ([[Open Source Software as a Commodity -Pioneering profitable FOSS venture capital]]). As a consequence, products will be much better (quality) and less expensive for the end consumers.

Commodifying Open Source Software development will have high-leverage outcomes on the global economy ([[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]]):

- For 1€ invested in OSS, we observe 800€ of increase in EU countries' GDP,
- Solow residual: Productivity (related to innovation inefficiencies) related to GDP,
- New way of working: Free workers are much more productive and $-empowered,


[[TODO]]: better document and analyse effects on the global economy.

#4 [[TODO]] demonstration that speculators create liquidity (= the past cost of R&D doesn't matter) and that (#1) always estimate the sum of FUTURE investments (doesn't matter what happened in the past) (#3)
#5 [[TODO]] market scenarios, including cheating and project governance failures (use examples from real-world and how they would have happened in Open Market + theoretical scenarios as well)
