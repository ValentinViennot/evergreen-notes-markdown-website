#### Are you happy in your current work situation?

Live survey:
- Yes
- No
Once voted, can see the results and a message:
"We are redefining the future of work. [ Tell us more! ]" (longer, open form survey)


### The future of innovation

The future of innovation will be open or won't be.
Open innovation comes with security, massive collaboration, and transparency.
Join us in creating **a world where every human can live from their craft**.


### Reinventing organizations

Your diverse skills are the engine driving community-led projects.
Here, you're more than a worker; you're a stakeholder in innovation.


### Impact. Sustainable innovation. Empowered communities.

Our quest is finding the most efficient way for our society to innovate sustainably.
Growth is not progress. Working with purpose to build meaningful solutions is.
We promote the greatest good for the greatest number.


### Objective: Time To Open-Source Alternative = -1

The “Time Till Open Source Alternative” (TTOSA) is currently measured in years.
We are aiming to make it **negative**: meaning the open-source alternative will exist first.
This is why we are solving the root cause: making open source an attractive **investment**.


### The future of work. Yours?

You have the right to **contribute great, meaningful work**.
If you don't agree with the destination, then you shouldn't have to be a part of the journey.
Collectively, we deserve better a journey.
