What is the hypothesis that we are trying to validate with FTVCs?
- People won't invest?
- Open source projects won't adhere?
- Incentives created are the right ones and powerful enough? 


WHO PAYS AND FOR WHAT / WHY? (SHOULD BE CLEAR AF)
Careful on token and web3 with FLOSS culture...


- Home — [[fuckthevcs.com - Home]]
	- Sell the vision and guide towards exploring subsections
- Contributors
	- It's a good way to get their project and work funded
- Users
	- It's a good use of their money
- Investors
	- Redefining 'Investing'—we are all investors
- Value creation
	- Redefine how we innovate
- Manifesto — [[fuckthevcs.com - Manifesto]]
	- Who we are, what we stand for


Team?
Projects? (fund.fuckthevcs.com)
Roadmap (high-level milestones)? (homepage?)
	and specific roadmap/milestones for the crowdfunding roadmap
Blog? (+ work with leaders/influencers to create content to explain vision etc)
Monitoring and feedback! (Git PRs, metrics, open feedback form)

**To enable each and every human to live from their craft.**

**Roadmap for NGI funding**: Explain vision, roadmap, etc.

Security of website.
Integrate with existing solutions?

A forest is more than a sum of trees, a choir is more than a sum of voices, etc.

Don't mention crypto at first, build an audience.

Build the platform V1—close access
Work with school economics
Seek funding: grants, loans etc.
Partner with open source projects (feature-level crowdfunding)
-> alternative design, 'invest' instead of 'donate'

Incorporate company, ~~pay low salaries~~, pay contract work.
Set-up first iteration of the crowdfunding platform (closed).
Work with Legal, Finance, Gov partners to ensure compliance.

Build in isolation at first, no integration with crypto stuff yet.


**TODO**: Move to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c3MdBwoPvDwTlGGyORrQ9OBO6DvY1z9UzdHwGFlKGtI/edit for share and review.


TODO: buy domain name for open market and publish place holder with simple manifesto (see obsidian) & mission.

(later?) explain the goals and current state + provide link to contribute (?).
--> create community (reddit/discourse/something?) to collaboratively work on this




FTVCs Branding.

Use existing tools to accommodate as first project (open collective, polar.sh, etc.).
Compensate with shares of the brand at a fixed valuation. Contract and legal work.
NOT WAGED LABOR. 




Problem solved: aligning incentives (consumers, contributors, investors, projects).

LEGAL ASSESSMENT FOR FUND.FUCKTHEVCS.COM
Before trading shares in the trademark, 

1. **Conceptual Development**: Begin by clearly defining your new concept. What is its purpose? How does it differ from existing securities like stocks or bonds? Understanding its unique features will be crucial in determining the legal and regulatory considerations.

2. **Legal and Regulatory Analysis**: Consult with legal experts, especially those specializing in securities law and financial regulations. They can help determine if your concept falls under existing securities laws. In many jurisdictions, the definition of a security is broad and could encompass new financial instruments. For example, in the U.S., the Howey Test is used to determine if something is a security.

3. **Compliance with Securities Laws**: If your concept qualifies as a security, you must comply with the relevant securities laws. This includes registration requirements, disclosure obligations, and adherence to trading regulations. Failing to comply can result in severe legal consequences.

4. **Creation of Legal Framework**: Draft a legal framework for your concept. This would include the terms and conditions, rights and obligations, and any other legal stipulations that define how your financial instrument works. This framework should be developed in consultation with legal experts to ensure it's enforceable and compliant with existing laws.

5. **Seek Regulatory Guidance or Approval**: Depending on the jurisdiction, you might be able to seek guidance or a no-action letter from the relevant regulatory authority (like the SEC in the U.S.). This can provide some assurance that your concept won't run afoul of current regulations.

6. **Innovation within Technology, like Blockchain**: If your concept involves digital or tokenized assets, it's important to consider how blockchain technology can be used. Tokenized securities are a rapidly evolving area and offer a way to create new types of financial instruments.

7. **Market Trust and Adoption**: Building trust in your new concept is crucial. This includes not only legal trust but also trust from potential investors and users. Transparency, clear communication, and adherence to best practices in financial regulation will be key.

8. **Ongoing Legal and Regulatory Monitoring**: Laws and regulations evolve, especially in response to new financial innovations. Stay informed about legal changes that could affect your concept.

9. **Potential Influence on Future Laws**: If your concept gains significant traction, it could influence future legislation and regulatory approaches.
