##### "We deserve better" (-> [[fuckthevcs.com - Manifesto|Manifesto]])
## The future of innovation is ours

Tech innovation is currently dominated by monopolistic platforms.
We deserve better products and services, serving our interests.
We refuse to let our knowledge become their new capital.
**Knowledge should always be free.**

Platforms made all of us prisoners of their incentives.
Venture capitalists now seek to create tech monopolies.
It's a game that we, workers and consumers, can only lose.

The future of innovation is open, collaborative, and decentralized.
**Let's reinvent the game.** (scroll down)


## Investing in communities with a purpose

Traditional investors are middle-men to value creation.
We all have the right to invest in and get returns from technology.
We are redefining the economic system with a new investment model.
Everyone can be an investor, a consumer, a contributor, and a project leader.

Not all problems are worth solving: Invest in communities today to curate tomorrow.

### Closing the loop: Direct-to-consumer innovation

Deploy your resources on communities with a purpose.
**Benefit from better open-source products, at low to no cost.**

### Transparent, direct, accessible incentives

Misaligned and hidden incentives encourage counterproductive rent-seeking solutions making things worse for everyone involved. We believe in the profit motive and the free markets. We propose an economic model with clear, causal, easy-to-understand incentives.

**We won't be the products anymore.**

### We are the finance arm of the free software movement

"The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we encourage everyone to run faster. When capitalism really works this way, it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it always works this way. If the runners forget why the reward is offered and become intent on winning, no matter how, they may find other strategies—such as, attacking other runners. If the runners get into a fist fight, they will all finish late." Richard Stallman, GNU Manifesto, 1985

**We now have the technology to decentralize both the race and the reward.**

### We are building an open market for purpose-driven communities

Innovation is currently inefficient, secretive, and not at the service of the consumers.
We propose to invest directly in the communities and purposes that are serving us.
Stop paying for expensive products, expensive in both time and money.
Instead invest in free, open innovation and get cheap, high quality, respectful, transparent products designed and built for your interests by inclusive and open communities.

[If OSS partners, it's a good place to showcase / mention them]

**Let's invest in our tomorrow, today.**


### The future of work is open, collaborative, decentralized

- We advocate for open-source collaboration as a means to drive genuine innovation and inclusivity.
- We redefine 'investment' as active participation in innovation, ensuring benefits are shared among all contributors.
- We adopt a decentralized approach to empower individuals and communities, moving away from centralized control.


### Innovation with a purpose
(link to value creation section)

`Value = Effort x Hype`

It's time to end dumb economics and stand for smart economics.
Smart economics serve our society's best interests. Maximizing utility.

#### Never pay anymore. Invest.
(link to users section)

Buying products generate margins, margins generate profits, profits generate (hopefully) investment, investment (hopefully) generates better products.

**Why not pay the right price and chose to invest in what you believe directly?**

#### Never work anymore. Invest.
(link to contributors section)

Working is an investment of your time. Time is the ultimate and most valuable currency.
There is no right exchange value for your labor, only you can decide what's fair.

**Why not invest your time and get a share of what you built?**


### Free users. Free workers. Free knowledge. Free innovation.


### We are building the first open source investment community.

### Help us take off

Our mission is to free innovation; democratizing access to technology and finance.

You believe in our mission? Great, us too.
We need cash to bootstrap our project and redefine the economic system.
Unfortunately, that's how it works.

##### How we are going to use the money

We are building a new economy, and money is the fuel of the economy.
Most of the individual effort we're putting in this project is for free, built on optimism.

The funding is going to be used for,
- Paying contract work (legal, finance, design, programmers...)
- Injecting grease in the new system

Check out our roadmap.


"The situation is desperate, anything is possible."
