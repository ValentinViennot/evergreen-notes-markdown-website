##### "We deserve better" (-> [[fuckthevcs.com - Manifesto|Manifesto]])
### Open innovation by and for all

Tech innovation is dominated by monopolistic platforms and lacks transparency.
We deserve better products and services.
We refuse to let our knowledge become their new capital.
Knowledge should always be free.
Platforms made all of us prisoners of their incentives.
Venture capitalists now _seek_ to create monopolies.
It's a game that we can only lose.

**Let's reinvent the game.** (scroll down)


## Investing in communities with a purpose

**Stop** consuming. **Start** investing.
Deploy your capital on communities with a purpose.
**Benefit from better open-source product at low to no cost.**

Together we grow stronger and further. You can play a part too.


##### Reinventing organisations
What is value? Why do we work?

##### Transparent, direct, accessible incentives

Attention rents, cloudalists, enshittification... these are the results of current misaligned and hidden incentives. We believe in the profit motive and the free markets. But we advocate for clear, causal, easy-to-understand incentives.

We are not the products.

##### We are the finance arm of the free software movement

"The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we encourage everyone to run faster. When capitalism really works this way, it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it always works this way. If the runners forget why the reward is offered and become intent on winning, no matter how, they may find other strategies—such as, attacking other runners. If the runners get into a fist fight, they will all finish late." Richard Stallman, GNU Manifesto, 1985

We now have the tools to decentralise the race and the reward.

##### We are building an open market for purpose-driven communities

Innovation is currently inefficient, secretive, and not at the service of the consumers.
We propose to invest directly in the communities and purposes that are serving us.
Stop paying for expensive products, expensive in both time and money.
Instead invest in free, open innovation and get cheap, high quality, respectful, transparent products built for your interests by inclusive and open communities.

Let's invest in our tomorrow, today.

##### The future of work is open, collaborative, decentralised

- We advocate for open-source collaboration as a means to drive genuine innovation and inclusivity.
- We redefine 'investment' as active participation in innovation, ensuring benefits are shared among all contributors.
- We adopt a decentralised approach to empower individuals and communities, moving away from centralised control.

##### Innovation with a purpose
(link to value creation section)

`Price = Time x Brand`

###### Never pay anymore. Invest.
(link to users section)

Buying products generate margins, margins generate profits, profits generate (hopefully) investment, investment (hopefully) generates better products.

Why not pay the right price and chose to invest in what you believe?

###### Never work anymore. Invest.
(link to contributors section)

Working is an investment of your time. Time is the ultimate and most valuable currency.
There is no right exchange value for your labor, only you can decide what's fair.

Why not invest your time and get a share of what you built?

##### Free users. Free workers. Free knowledge.

Free innovation.

##### We are building the first open source investment community.

##### Help us take off

You believe in our mission? Great, us too.
We need cash to bootstrap our project and redefine the economic system.
Unfortunately, that's how it works.

###### How we are going to use the money

We are building a new economy, and money is the fuel of the economy.
Most of the individual effort we're putting in this project is for free, built on optimism.

The funding is going to be used for,
- Paying contract work (legal, finance, design, programmers...)
- Inject in the new system (= grease)
