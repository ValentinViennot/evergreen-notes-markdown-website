**Hypothesis are hidden truths we want to discover.**

Hypotheses are specific statements or educated guesses that propose a relationship or explanation within a system.
They are testable and are formulated based on existing knowledge or observations.
Hypotheses are used to guide research and are subject to testing and analysis to determine their validity.
They are a fundamental part of the scientific method, where they are either supported or rejected through empirical evidence.

([[Science is not about finding the truth, it's about knowing what we don't know]])

We didn't take them for granted for building [[The Open Market]].
In that way, they are different than our [[Open Market Assumptions]].

WHAT DO WE WANT TO LEARN? ([[The Lean Startup]])

Hypothesis shouldn't be things we can answer with ChatGPT/Google Search.
Hypothesis should be things we can only answer with a (product) experiment.

**Our goal is to formulate lots of hypothesis that will help us learn fast and create value for our users and customers.**

_[[TODO]] / WIP_

- OSS consumers are ready to pay for future open-source development in order to get additional value from the software that they use or influence its direction ([[Human Labour is what creates Value]])
	- pay-for-play ability to influence roadmap
	- pay-for-features
- 
- TODO: based on [[The changing way of working]]
	- OSS contributors willing to work for brand share more than $ (provided the share is worth something)
- 
- TODO: based on [[Nothing can compete with Open Source]]
	- Could maybe be proven with research/deductive arguments
- 
- TODO: Developer Coins?
- TODO: LICENCE
- TODO: Dilution does not influence [[Brand value]] (ie Apple is not less worth because every one has iPhones) —counterintuitive —+see Axioms
- TODO: pre-conceived ideas on Open source licences hurt true OSS (SSPL, AGPL...)
- TODO: OSS is difficult to adopt because of lack of support (SLA/MCO)
- TODO: OSS is difficult to adopt because of lack of liability

- TODO: OSS projects ready to sell shares of their trademarks??? —how to?
- 

- TODO: Would the BRAND VALUE as defined by Open Market get recognised by external entities? (eg markets, auditors, govs)
