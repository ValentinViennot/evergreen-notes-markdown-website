**Hypothesis are hidden truths we want to discover.**

Hypotheses are specific statements or educated guesses that propose a relationship or explanation within a system.
They are testable and are formulated based on existing knowledge or observations.
Hypotheses are used to guide research and are subject to testing and analysis to determine their validity.
They are a fundamental part of the scientific method, where they are either supported or rejected through empirical evidence.

([[Science is not about finding the truth, it's about knowing what we don't know]])

We didn't take them for granted for building [[The Open Market]].
In that way, they are different than our [[Open Market Assumptions]].

WHAT DO WE WANT TO LEARN? ([[The Lean Startup]])

Hypothesis shouldn't be things we can answer with ChatGPT/a Google Search.
Hypothesis should be things we can only answer with a (product) experiment.

**Our goal is to formulate lots of hypothesis that will help us learn fast and create value for our users and customers.**
