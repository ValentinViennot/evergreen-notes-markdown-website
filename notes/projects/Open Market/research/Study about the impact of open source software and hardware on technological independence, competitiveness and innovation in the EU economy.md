[European Commission, September 2021, Study about the impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and)

The European Commission wanted to understand how "Open Source" (both software and hardware) affects Europe's economy, technology independence, competitiveness, and innovation.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Introduction:**

   - The study looked at the benefits, costs, and how open source is used commercially.
   - **The goal is to see if Europe can boost its economy and create more jobs using open source.**

2. **Economic Analysis:**

   - European developers play a big role in the global open-source community.
   - Small European businesses are very active in contributing to open source. In contrast, in the US, big tech companies contribute more.
   - Investing in open source can boost Europe's economy. **If contributions increased by 10%, it could make the economy grow by 0.4% to 0.6% more each year.**
   - Governments can save money by using open source. Plus, they won't be stuck with just one supplier (vendor lock-in).
   - Open source had a €65 to €95 billion impact on European economies in 2018.
   - Smaller companies tend to invest more in open source relative to their size.

3. **Survey Results:**

   - Most responders were software developers or related businesses.
   - Start-ups and small companies benefit a lot from open source.
   - Main reasons for using open source: technical solutions, avoiding being tied to one vendor, developing good quality code, and learning.
   - Saving costs and being a part of the open-source community also were big motivators.
   - Being a part of open-source projects leads to indirect benefits rather than direct profits.

4. **Case Studies:**

   - Foundations play a key role in open-source development, providing standardisation and knowledge transfer.
   - Many projects get funding from outside Europe and have contributors worldwide.

5. **Policy Analysis:**

   - Different countries have different strategies for promoting open source.
   - Governments in Europe focus on the public sector, whereas in Asia, the focus is more on the private sector.
   - Public sector policies about open source often don't work well unless open source becomes a core part of a country's digital culture.

6. **Recommendations:**

   - **For the Public Sector:** Make open source a key part of digital strategies. Invest in open-source projects and refer to official open-source definitions.
   - **For R&D and Growth:** Fund more open-source projects. Encourage public research organizations and schools to teach open source.
   - **For Business:** Consider open-source contributions as charitable donations for tax breaks. Fund security checks of critical open-source projects. Improve open source's role in public procurement.
   - **For Open Source Hardware:** Fund research centers focused on open-source hardware.
   - **For Specific Domains:** Support open source in artificial intelligence and in hardware areas like Field Programmable Gate Arrays.
   - **For Sustainability:** Recognize the benefits of open source in prolonging the life of devices, supporting a "right to repair".

In a nutshell, open source has a big positive impact on Europe's economy, and with the right steps, it can lead to even more growth, innovation, and sustainability.

According to the provided study from the European Commission, based on public domain information, companies located in the EU invested approximately €1 billion in Open Source Software (OSS) in 2018. The study concluded that a 10% increase in contributions would generate between 0.4% and 0.6% additional EU GDP per year.

Given that a 10% increase in the €1 billion investment (i.e., €100 million) leads to a 0.4% to 0.6% increase in the EU's GDP, we can deduce the impact of a single euro (1€) investment:

Let's consider the average percentage increase of 0.5% for simplicity. 
If €100 million leads to a 0.5% increase, then 1€ would result in:

- (0.5% / 100,000,000) * 1€ = 0.000005% increase in the EU's GDP.

This means for every 1€ invested in Open Source Software, the EU's GDP would increase by 0.000005%. While this might seem like a very small fraction, when scaled to larger investments, the cumulative impact becomes significant.

Given that Europe's GDP in 2018 was $15,979.88 billion (or roughly $15.98 trillion), and using the information from the European Commission study, we can calculate the impact of an additional 1€ investment in Open Source Software (OSS) on Europe's GDP in actual value.

- 0.00000005 x 15.98 x 10^9 = €799

Therefore,

**For every additional 1€ invested in Open Source Software, Europe's GDP would increase by up to 800€** (exponential growth?).

_Keep in mind that this is a simplified interpretation based on average values and the provided data. Actual economic dynamics are more complex, but this gives a basic idea of the potential return on investment from OSS in the European context._
