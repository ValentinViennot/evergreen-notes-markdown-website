**Axioms for [[The Open Market]].**

Axioms are the fundamental rules we define for our new system ([[The Open Market Economy]]).

In general, Axioms are fundamental statements or propositions that are considered self-evidently true within a particular logical or mathematical system.

They can then get used as the starting point for building logical arguments and proofs within that system. These axioms are the truth of our new model: [[The Open Market]].

**Our goal is to keep this list as minimal and high-level/conceptual as possible.**
