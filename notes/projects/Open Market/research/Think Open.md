**Summary of the [European Commission Open Source Strategy (2020-2023) Document](https://commission.europa.eu/news/european-commission-adopts-its-new-open-source-software-strategy-2020-2023-2020-10-21_en):**

The European Commission seeks to rejuvenate the EU's social market economy, foster competition, and support small and medium-sized enterprises. One of their key tools to achieve this is open source software.

1. **Open Source's Ubiquity:** Open source software is everywhere, from supercomputers to household appliances. It's behind many technological advances like blockchain, IoT, and AI, and is crucial for many sectors, including air traffic control.

2. **Advantages of Open Source:** 
	- It's a public code, ensuring good use of public funds and avoiding vendor lock-ins.
	- Allows easy software reuse, promotes cross-border interoperability, and increases efficiency.
	- Adding features is straightforward, and these can be freely shared.

3. **Collaboration:** By working with member states, companies, and the general public, the commission aims to develop innovative digital solutions that align with common policies and support technological sovereignty.

4. **Incremental Innovation:** Open source fosters innovation by sharing knowledge and solutions, building trust in public services.

5. **Security:** Open source enables rigorous security checks and independent audits, enhancing software safety.

6. **Strategic Focus:** The 2020-2023 open source strategy aims to strengthen the Commission's working culture based on open-source principles.

7. **Goals:** The strategy targets EU-wide digital transformation. It aims to co-create technology, protect European values, and influence the future positively.

8. **Connecting Policies:** The strategy aligns with key EU policies and legislation, including supporting President von der Leyen’s Political guidelines and linking with the proposed Digital Europe program.

9. **Goals and Outcomes:** Open source software helps deliver better ICT solutions, is a catalyst for change, and supports digital autonomy, emphasising European values and innovation.

10. **Governing Principles:** The Commission aims to:

   - **Think Open:** Prefer open-source solutions when feasible.
   - **Transform:** Use open source to innovate and co-create.
   - **Share:** Make code accessible and enable contributions to open-source projects.
   - **Contribute:** Be an active participant in the open-source ecosystem.
   - **Secure:** Ensure continuous security testing for code.
   - **Stay in Control:** Champion open standards and specifications in open source.


- **Open Source as a Public Service Essence:** Open source isn't just software. It embodies the spirit of public service by being transparent, efficient, and offering freedom from vendor lock-ins.
- **Europe’s Potential Technological Sovereignty:** While Europe may not be able to compete with tech giants (hyper-scalers), open source can be a way for it to maintain technological autonomy, ensuring control over its digital processes and technology.
- **Building on Existing Culture:** The European Commission already has a culture leaning towards open source, with many of its systems and projects based on open source. This strategy aims to reinforce and expand that culture.
- **Open Source as a Civic Duty:** Sharing the Commission's source code isn't just about technological advancement. It's seen as a civic responsibility that can lower costs and increase knowledge for society at large.
- **Holistic Approach:** This strategy isn't isolated. It links with other significant EU programs and strategies, ensuring a comprehensive and integrated approach to the digital transformation of Europe.

In essence, the European Commission believes that open source is a vehicle to drive Europe towards a more **inclusive**, **transparent**, and **efficient** future, deeply integrating the principles of open collaboration, shared innovation, and public benefit.
