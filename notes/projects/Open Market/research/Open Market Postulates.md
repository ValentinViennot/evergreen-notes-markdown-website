**First Principles on which [[The Open Market]] depends.**

What can we say that is true in the current World?

First Principles should not depend on anything else.
Here, we safely limit our root cause analysis to the axioms of [[Capitalism]].

Meaning, for the sake of the [[Open Market Postulates]] analysis,
we can consider the laws of a Capitalist Economy as set in stone as the law of Physics.

_Of course, this isn't the case, and [[The Open Market]] aims to change that._

**We will try to mostly make strategic decisions and define [[Open Market Axioms]] that only rely on these [[Open Market Postulates]] about the Global Economy.**

_[[TODO]] / WIP_

- [[The way we innovate is totally inefficient]]
	- Entrepreneurs are guessing need rather than asking
	- Innovation happens behind closed doors
	- Innovation happens in isolation
	- IP is being destroyed once a project fails
	- Corporations create needs
	- Most products are going to fail or wrongly succeed 
		- Local optimums, not the best (social value) solution
	- Most startups are going to fail (for random reasons)
- [[Open Source is not profitable]] ([Why Open Source isn't Profitable](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/))
- [[Happy workers are better workers]]
- Profit is the ultimate motive
	- Profit is the result of subtracting costs from revenue
	- Market operates based on the motive of profit
		-  Investments in markets are made with an expectation of returns
- Separate economy can influence global economy
	- As proven by Crypto market / Web3
- Software abundance: Once created, software can be duplicated at virtually no cost
- Economies function primarily as systems of exchange
	- Money is worth nothing (or not much) if not moving
- Though freely available, open-source software have intrinsic higher societal worth
	- [[Open Source has the biggest added value]]
- Every investment carries a level of risk relative to its expected returns
- Market dynamics are mutable based on consumer demands and needs
- Value can be created, not just shifted or transferred
- Despite its digital nature, software has tangible impactâ€”economic, societal, or otherwise
- Profit mechanisms must shift to be sustainable and not exploit finite resources
- Open-source inherently supports transparency and community collaboration
- Prices and market dynamics are influenced by the balance of supply and demand
- Economic, technological, and societal systems are interdependent and co-influenced
- Most innovation now happens through services and some software development
- Open-source models are superior in all aspects to proprietary models
- [[The winner takes it all]]
- [[At the end of a Monopoly game, there can only be one winner]]
