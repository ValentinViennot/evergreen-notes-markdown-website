**First Principles on which [[The Open Market]] depends.**

What can we say that is true in the current World?

First Principles should not depend on anything else.
Here, we safely limit our root cause analysis to the axioms of [[Capitalism]].

Meaning, for the sake of the [[Open Market Postulates]] analysis,
we can consider the laws of a Capitalist Economy as set in stone as the law of Physics.

_Of course, this isn't the case, and [[The Open Market]] aims to change that._

**We will try to mostly make strategic decisions and define [[Open Market Axioms]] that only rely on these [[Open Market Postulates]] about the Global Economy.**
