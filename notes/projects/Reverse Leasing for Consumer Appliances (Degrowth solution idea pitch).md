Growth issue: Degrowth vs Technical Progress  

Provide a compelling solution to the Degrowth ambitions without slowing down technical progress.
  
For Appliance consumers  
  
Who want always new products with new functionalities but in a sustainable manner  
  
And that are not satisfied with the lack of repairability or rather modularity and evolvability of current appliances  
  
Our product is a repurposing/reconditioning platform that commit to buy you back your used product in 3 to 5 years when you buy them.  
  
Unlike other solutions like  
- Leasing platforms, that are unsustainable for the planet and don't give you ownership of your products,  
- Le Bon Coin or Craigslist and also traditional reconditioning platforms that only address the second hand market and a circular economy that does not support technical progress AND often with the uncertainty of not finding a buyer  
  
On one hand, our platform contractually commits to buy you back your appliance in a few years at a fixed price depending on its condition.  
On the other hand we partner with manufacturers to build products that are easier to repurpose/recondition, and we provide them back with the reconditioned parts in order to build newer, more modern and advanced products that will then be sold again.  
  
In short, we create a reversed leasing platform that creates a circular business model supporting technical progress.
