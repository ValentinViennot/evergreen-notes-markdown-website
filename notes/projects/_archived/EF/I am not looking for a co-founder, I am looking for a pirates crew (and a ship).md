I am setting myself to build something really hard: [[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]].

Getting there will be difficult. But it's worth it ([[The Open Market Manifesto (old)]]).

However, this is **my** dream ([[I'm gonna be King of the Pirates]]).

To get there, I will need a crew. Skilled dreamers, sharing my ambition and values.
But this won't ever be their dream ([[Others are not in your mind]]).

Therefore, **only I** must wear the Captain hat.

And as the Captain, I must ensure that our dreams are aligned and that we are getting in a right direction that will benefit everyone ([[Empower your crew to reach their dreams]], [[As the Captain, you are responsible for the direction]]).

Building [[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]] is not your usual [[Start-up]].

It is in fact many start-ups. Multiple teams building almost-independent blocks under extremely uncertain conditions. When all these blocks will come together, our success will be huge ([[The Open Market]]).

No block is more important than the other.
And the Captain must ensure that every block builder is empowered,
and that all the blocks come together.
**The Captain is responsible for the success (or sinking) of the ship.**

At this point, here are the blocks I deem the most important ones (but this will evolve over the upcoming days and weeks ([[2023-09-30]])):

- Finance/Economy ([[Open Market Economy]])
- Technology ([[The Open Market Infrastructure]])
- Product and Operations ([[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]])
- Compliance ([[Open Market Exchange]])
- Legal / Open Source community collaboration ([[Open Market Licence]])
- Communication with all sides

That last two ones, I can handle for now.
For the other ones, I'd need to soon find Pirates.
