[[I'm gonna be King of the Pirates]]!

At EF, my goal is to build [[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]].

Aligned with [[My mission]], there's an idea —or rather a problem— I've been wanting to work on. This is the fact that [[Open Source is not profitable]]. And that despite [[Open Source has the biggest added value]] and [[Open source should be the only way]].

In fact, I believe there is a fundamental issue with the way our current society innovates ([[The way we innovate is totally inefficient]]). And that the root cause is in our economic system ([[Capitalism is over]], [[The 0$ open source company]]).

I've been thinking about a project, [[The Open Market]], that aims to find a solution to the lack of a sustainable investment system for open-source projects.

In the spirit of [[What is the best thing you could be working on and why aren't you?]]: this idea, [[The Open Market]], is —I believe— the best thing I could be working on.
If I am not, yet, this is because it would require scale and resources that I couldn't access right now.

[[EF]] ([[EF W23 PA CORE]]) can help me:

- Meet [[The right co-founder]]
- Get started on a concrete [[Start-up]] project
- Seek [[VC funding]] —or any funding to fuel my ambition

I want to aim as high and big as possible. And [[The Open Market]] could be it.

The more I think about it, the more I realise this project is in fact aiming to reshape society —and our way of working ([[The changing way of working]]). And, long term, have the biggest leverage to contribute to [[My mission]].

It's also very much aligned with [[Looking 5 years ahead]] and [[Looking 10 years ahead]].
Eventually, I aim to help others to change the world —funding as many ideas and projects as possible. [[The Open Market]] stands for and enables that ambition.

I am aware that this is a hard and difficult ambition. It requires to:

1. **Build** something compatible with the current system
2. **Let go** of society norms and the status quo
3. **Rethink** everything from the ground up

In fact, (3) is probably the most important attribute here.
Without this, this would be just another failed idealistic attempt.
If what we build is an excellent player in the current system, then our chances of success and transforming the system are non zero. And because they are, **I must try**.

(Pragmatic idealism and Thinking in systems.)

The following is a brain dump of a possible strategy I have in mind at this point:

1. OSS assurance for companies (revenue/sustaining/subsidising)
2. Open market (subsidising methodology)
3. (Bonus) European market advantage (OSS+disrupt tech market)
