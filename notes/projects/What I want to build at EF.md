_(This note is a WIP/Brain dump)_

Aligned with [[My mission]], there's an idea —or rather a problem— I've been wanting to work on. This is the fact that [[Open source has no added value]]. And I think that despite being a strong believer that [[Open source should be the only way]].

In fact, I believe there is a fundamental issue with the way our current society innovates ([[Why do we innovate like this?]]). And that the root cause is in our economic system ([[Capitalism is over]], [[The 0$ open source company]]).

I've been thinking about a project, [[The Open Market]], that aims to find a solution to the lack of a sustainable investment system for open-source projects.

In the spirit of [[What is the best thing you could be working on and why aren't you?]]: this idea, [[The Open Market]], is —I believe— the best thing I could be working on.
And I am not (beyond these notes) because it requires scale and resources I can't access right now.

[[EF]] can help me:
- Meet the right co-founder
- Get started on a concrete [[Start-up]] project
- Seek [[VC funding]]

My goal should be to make the most of it and aim as high and big as possible.

[[The Open Market]] could be it.

The more I think about it, the more I realise this project is in fact aiming to reshape society —and our way of working ([[The changing way of working]]). 

This is a difficult and hard ambition. It requires to:
1. Let go of society norms and the status quo
2. Rethink everything from the ground up
3. Build something compatible with the current system

In fact, (3) is probably the most important attribute here.
Without this, this would be just another failed idealistic attempt.
If what we build is an excellent player in the current system, then our chances of success and transforming the system might be above zero.

What we need is a pragmatic idealism and thinking in systems.

Depending on who I meet and how things go, I think this idea might be the best fit for something like the [[EF W23 PA CORE]] programme.

The following is a brain dump of a possible strategy I have in mind at this point:
1. OSS assurance for companies (revenue/sustaining/subsidising)
2. Open market (subsidising methodology)
3. (Bonus) European market advantage (OSS+Tech)
