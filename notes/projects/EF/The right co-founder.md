_"I read somewhere that finding product/market fit feels like stepping on a landmine. The moment you find the right co-founder is similar". Tuhin Chakraborty, CEO, Mimica_

The best way to evaluate is to start working together and assess traction/productivity.

For [[EF W23 PA CORE]], I want to be **CEO** ([[Why CEO?]]).

**I'm in search of a pragmatic technical visionary, committed to societal progress and mutual growth, who can turn vision into tangible innovation.**

I have a vision ([[The Open Market]]) and it's my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take it to being reality.
I must —I need to— be the one holding this vision until it becomes a true thing.

Therefore, I am looking for the ideal CTO in order to share this journey together.
([[Good CTO, Great CTO]]) — ((_or maybe it's a **CMO, CFO, CRO... CxO**...?_))

I want to be the one responsible for the vision and its business model.
I need someone who can take my vision and transform it into a technical product.

I am myself very technical ([[What's my edge?]]), and therefore very demanding.
The right fit is someone who will challenge and impress me, on concepts.

Someone with the following traits will reveal the best version of myself:

- Structured debate and ability to manage disagreements productively
- An ability to translate vision into actionable steps
- Desire to challenge existing systems and beliefs
- Passion for improving society
- Openness (all dimensions)
- High integrity
- Patience

([[My values]])

As an **ENTP** ([[Obsessions]]), the following personalities should be my best matches
(_but let's not limit ourselves to any kind of boundaries_):

- INFJ, INTJ, INTP, ENFP
- and most generally all intuitive (xNxx) types

I greatly value the following skills, with no particular order or requirement:

- A strong technical background, particularly in distributed systems (blockchain, web3)
- Technical rigour, open-mindedness, and a gift for complex systems design
- Understanding of financial markets and economics principles
- A disciplined practice to validating complex systems
- Able to articulate & challenge high-level concepts
- A taste for user experience design
- A passion for [[Open innovation is the healthiest competition|Open Innovation]]

Additionally, I value open-mindedness, intellectual curiosity, and shared high-level values, as a strong personal connection is essential for a successful partnership.
