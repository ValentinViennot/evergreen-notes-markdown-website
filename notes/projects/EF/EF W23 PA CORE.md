A bit like daily notes, this running note aims to gather my thoughts and journaling and thinking about the [[EF]] programme I just joined.

## What's up?

**Open source isn't profitable, yet it should be the way forward** ([[Open source should be the only way]], [[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]]). It's a glaring problem that I'm itching to tackle, especially since our current innovation system is so broken. I know that building this can be massive, something that could scale and shift paradigms, but it's a beast, and I'm just gearing up with the resources and the roadmap.

Every week, I dive deeper into the complexities and potential of my mission. The initial enthusiasm remains, but it's now tempered with a more measured approach, as I've learned that enthusiasm alone won't bend the rigid economic structures in place. 

I'm juggling the demands of being a visionary and the practicalities of being a doer. In these weeks, I've faced the hard truth that change isn't just hard—it's a mountain to move. And yet, as I strategise, write, and pitch, the path clears a bit more each day.

My mind is constantly running scenarios, playing out the steps to make [[The Open Market]] a reality. 

As I edge closer to action, I find the balance between my ideals and what the market can bear. I'm figuring out how to make open source not only valuable but indispensable and lucrative. It's about finding the right incentives, the right words, and the right people who get it.  

It's not just about starting a company; it's about starting a revolution in how we think about and fund open source. And I'm just getting started.

## Week 9 ([[2023-week-46]])

- _NEXT_
	- Meet [[Andrej]] in person.

## Week 8 ([[2023-week-45]])

"Free as in puppy"

- _WIP_ — Goals for the week
	- Meet with institutional (potential) partners
	- Explore and compare different options to get started (startup studio, crowdfund, etc)
		- Different models, different GTM strategies, different verticals.
	- Write notes to clarify thoughts.
	- Progress Open Market white paper , iterate typical and edge scenarios.
	- Propose an updated roadmap for tBTCoE
	- Actively explore funding options: in particular, grants and BAs.
	- Finish the "Presentation" deck (for cofounders and internal use)
	- From "Presentation", prepare a "Pitch" focused on one approach.

## Week 7 ([[2023-week-44]])

["Will of the People"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MClg7zpm6VQ)

- There isn't a lack of funding with open source.
	- The real issue is the lack of a direct incentive.
		- In other words, the lack of profitability.
			- Feels like going circle, but this actually changes the focus!
				- or rather, this re-focuses us.
- Game theory.
	- As I've been progressing the writing of my Open Market White paper,
		- Game theory is becoming an increasingly important part of it.
		- In addition, I believe that collaborating with schools of economics could be great
			- They would win a real-world experiment about free innovation
			- And I would win a research about the impact of such solution
- Tokenising Open Source Brands.
	- Apparently, "Tokenisation" is the new Web3 keyword.
		- It's a Bear market but investors are still showing up.
		- There's room for "the right solution".
			- There's also a lot more scrutiny on speculative projects.
- Writing.
	- Treating well the topic of funding open source is leading me to deeply complex places
		- Philosophy
		- Economics
		- Game theory
		- Finance
	- It's easy to get lost. I feel like I need to develop these sides as well, but keeping focused.
	- I am thinking about co-authoring with [[Edoardo]] in order to develop my thinking.
	- While 1/ not being alone, 2/ staying focused.
- Principle-driven
	- The other aspect that is making my life difficult is that my project is Principle-driven.
	- I am not "just solving" an issue. I am obeying to a higher Principle.
	- [[Inventing on Principle]]
- Options.
	- Starting point options are multiple.
	- I'm back to the starting point, picking the best entrance door.
	- Next week should be about experimenting with these options and picking one.
	- Talking to consumers, domain experts, investors, and understanding the markets.
	- For instance, a few of the options I'm currently considering are,
		- Start-up studio model for government-focused OSS
		- Crowdfunding model for gaming tools and games
		- Feature-level crowdfunding for privacy-focused consumer apps
		- DeSo-like platform for OSS investment, extending APIs to use cases

## Week 6 ([[2023-week-43]])

["King of the Pirates"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flysqk6WfQE)

- "We're back to before Capitalism was invented"
	- This is my biggest learning of the week.
- This week I talked to multiple FLOSS projects and contributors
	- Including but not limited to,
		- Mattermost
		- NPM creator (isaacs)
		- Ex-Canonicalers
		- 'Amo' engineer (on the ex-Zenly founder team)
	- As well as a few VCs and BAs
- And what I learned is that: CHANGE IS HARD
	- Well, I didn't learn it... I already knew it.
	- But somehow it was here and I didn't pay enough attention.
	- Now it's painfully clear: people don't want change.
	- Or—worse—they wan't it but they'll do nothing for it to happen.
- I'm being excessively negative here—and maybe that's part of the problem
	- But what's certain is that unless I lead a movement
	- Nothing of what I'm proposing will ever happen.
- We're back to before Capitalism was established.
	- Most people hate the feudalism status quo.
	- But most people won't do anything about it.
	- And those who want to do something, disagree.
		- **Adam Smith** (1723-1790) - Advocated for free market principles and specialisation, arguing for economic freedom to drive societal benefit in "The Wealth of Nations" (1776).
		- **Karl Marx** (1818-1883) - Critiqued the exploitative nature of capitalism in "Das Kapital" (1867) and influenced the discourse on economic systems transitioning from feudalism.
		- **Max Weber** (1864-1920) - Explored the cultural aspects of capitalism, suggesting Protestant ethics shaped its development in "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism" (1905).
		- **John Locke** (1632-1704) - Posited the rights to life, liberty, and property in "Two Treatises of Government" (1689), influencing liberal capitalist thought.
		- **David Ricardo** (1772-1823) - Introduced the comparative advantage theory in "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" (1817), promoting free trade as a pillar of capitalism.
		- **Jean-Baptiste Say** (1767-1832) - Formulated Say's Law, arguing that supply creates its own demand in "A Treatise on Political Economy" (1803), supporting capitalist market dynamics.
		- **Thomas Malthus** (1766-1834) - His "Essay on the Principle of Population" (1798) influenced capitalist views on population control and economic sustainability.
		- **John Stuart Mill** (1806-1873) - Explored economic principles and advocated for social reforms within capitalism in "Principles of Political Economy" (1848).
	- 'Rome wasn't built in one day'
- According to Yanis Varoufakis' book "Technofeudalism" we're back to feudalism
	- Because of fundamental changes that came with digitalisation
	- And very bad financial regulation/actions from our governments
- As a Democratic-socialist Technoliberalist, we need transformation:
	- We believe in free markets: the market should allocate resources.
	- We believe in free knowledge: see, study, modify, and share.
	- We believe in free workers: deciding their work and getting a share.
	- We believe in free users: choice, privacy, interoperability.
	- We believe in profit incentives: aiming for Pareto efficiency.
	- We believe in transparency: open governance should be the norm.
	- We believe in social value: our economic system should serve us, humans.

## Week 5 ([[2023-week-42]])

"XN-42"

- "Jamais deux sans trois" —this week was again not so much productive.
- Most of my meetings scheduled this week got pushed back.
- This seems to be a busy period for my target contacts,
	- even friends take more time to reply
	- Time is now flying, which is a bad sign.
- This week I did try to break my circular dependency,
	- But I need to be more pushy, pragmatic and efficient.
	- —for strategic reasons, I'll keep confidential this week doings and learnings
- Wrote the draft for [[Funding open source vs Saving the planet]]
	- An essay on the [[Tragedy of the Commons]]
		- Applied to (FL)OSS and [[The Open Market]] approach
	- I'll publish it early next week and ask for feedback.
		- As [[Edoardo]] said, am I trying to write a life economic paper ...
			- or to build something?! -> focus on this.
- With [[Sarah]], I started working on the [[Pilot proposal]]
	- With a more structured approach.
- I need to make changes in my lifestyle to improve productivity,
	- In particular: I need to move places.

"Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising every time we fall." – Confucius

## Week 4 ([[2023-week-41]])

"Break"

- _Week 4 was a 'break' week_
- I traveled back to Nice and enjoyed the last days of 'summer'
- I only met a few people but I could move forward with the
	- [[Take me to the Pilot (October 23)]]
- [[The Open Market White Paper (Method-Outline)]]
	- I used the opportunity on the train to start doing demonstrations
	- And mathematically demonstrate that [[The Open Market]]
		- was indeed estimating the future investment of OSS projects.
		- This is a key demonstration to prove the validity of the concept.
- I'll reference/feature the white paper and demonstrations from the
	- [[Pilot proposal]]

## Week 3 ([[2023-week-40]])

"Take me to the pilot"

- Up: The first three weeks were particularly intense
- This fourth week was the down of the up
- Many reasons caused a lack of focus and productivity
- In parallel I also faced more difficulties organising meetings
- As a consequence I failed to learn as quickly as the first weeks.

## Week 2 ([[2023-week-39]])

"The heat pump"

- This week I decided I would [[Do something crazy every day]]
	- Allowing myself to dream too big ([[Don't be afraid to dream out loud]])
	- As a consequence, I started reaching out out of my league (advisors, etc)
		- [[Don't be afraid to ask]]
- Started the week meeting with [[Edoardo]] and [[Sarah]] on Sunday
	- I'll convince them to come on board with me when the time is right
	- But first I need to get things started and tangible ([[Mapping Assumptions]])
- This week my goal was to do deep consumer discovery on both ends
	- Consumers
	- Contributors
- And to design an experiment that would run on week 3 (the official first week of the programme  — _Learnings are going to be kept private for now (not [[Building in public]] for this part)_
	- Week 2, my learnings helped me prove the market potential exists: there is a market to be created and a leader place to be taken.
- I believe that my decision to stop actively looking for a co-founder and trying to fit with the EF framework was the right one. In fact, I am now convinced that [[I am not looking for a co-founder, I am looking for a pirates crew (and a ship)]].
	- I now need to move fast and make it as tangible as possible to start building
		- And soon, shipping
	- My vision is complex and will require many "[[Start-up]]s" (as per Eric Ries definition). The ambition is huge, and so is the potential success.
		- This is my dream and **I must be the Captain of this ship.**
			- [[As the Captain, you are responsible for the direction]]
			- [[EF contract and tBTCoE dilution terms]]
- Next week, my focus will be on
	- Running experiments and research+discovery to de-risk my assumptions
	- Re-assessing my decision to move on 'solo' (as a Captain)
	- Having a clear plan for moving to the next stage (= building)

## Week 1 ([[2023-week-38]])

"How I met my co-founder"

- Started the week meeting with [[Andi]] (Sunday)
	- We hadn't seen each other in person for 3 years
	- Inspiring and motivating to get started with [[What I want to build at EF]]
	- Discussed in depth [[The Open Market Manifesto]]
		- and [[Open Market random notes (WIP)]]
	- And many other philosophical topics!
- I have the answer to [[Why CEO?]]
	- I might not be looking for a "co-founder" in the end
		- I have a very clear and determined vision
		- I am going to build [[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]]
			- And patch our Economic System with an Upgrade
				- To fix alienation, capital concentration, and innovation inefficiencies
					- [[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]]
					- a Marxist Startup Studio
			- I am going to free workers, and free intellectual property
				- Building The European Dream
- Published https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/
- I am feeling super happy and free and inspired! All positive so far
- Decided to relax a bit from [[EF]] guidance and methodology
	- In the end, my situation might be different enough that it deserves exceptions
	- I will stop my co-founder search for now
		- And start building
			- I will re-assess this decision end of next week

## Week 0 ([[2023-week-37]])

"Game plan"

- I've been thinking a lot about [[What I want to build at EF]]
	- There's a lot of unknowns and it's making me nervous
		- I think I have something like [[FIAMO]]
	- I'm torn between ideas that I can see making short-term profits and attracting investors (such as [[GPT-based appliance manuals]] or [[GPT-based AB testing]])
	- and my big life idea: [[The Open Market]]
		- _after discussing with [[Miks]] I am now convinced I need to build this one._
		- _but_ it requires to find concrete hypothesis that can be tested and validated (and here validated means: generate revenue —or some metric that, in the context of what we build, is announcing revenue)
			- [[How to be a Founder]]
			- [[The Mom Test]]
		- And it requires me to find and convince someone from [[EF W23 PA CORE]] to build it with me (and ideally, a CTO.)
- Trying to rework my [[Open Market random notes (WIP)]] and writings into [[Evergreen notes]]
	- I previously aimed to write blogs (such as https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/open-market-series/)
		- But blogging requires finished thoughts
	- Notes, especially [[Evergreen notes]], seem to be much more adapted here
- I wrote [[The Open Market Manifesto]] —Now about to share it!
	- I also went the drawing way (inspired by [[The Back of the Napkin]]) and drew a comprehensive vision [from the status quo to the Open Market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RTec72Niv_KrLNu12v-U8Q_a22dbKKJd/view?usp=sharing).
- I'm pretty clear that I want to be CEO. I want to be making the strategic decisions and be the one taking it from a vision to being an actual, concrete company.
	- But I also know that , eventually , I don't aspire to be a CEO. I rather see myself on multiple boards and helping others to start projects.
		- Note to write: [[Why CEO?]]
		- [[Looking 5 years ahead]] [[Looking 10 years ahead]]
