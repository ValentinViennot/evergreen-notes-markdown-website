A bit like daily notes, this running note aims to gather my thoughts and journaling and thinking about the [[EF]] programme I just joined.

- [[EF shortlist]]

## Week 1 ([[2023-week-38]])

- Started the week meeting with [[Andi]] (Sunday)
	- We hadn't seen each other in person for 3 years
	- Inspiring and motivating to get started with [[What I want to build at EF]]
	- Discussed in depth [[The Open Market manifesto]]
		- and [[Open Market random notes (WIP)]]
	- And many other philosophical topics!
- I might have the answer to [[Why CEO?]]

## Week 0 ([[2023-week-37]])

- I've been thinking a lot about [[What I want to build at EF]]
	- There's a lot of unknowns and it's making me nervous
		- I think I have something like [[FIAMO]]
	- I'm torn between ideas that I can see making short-term profits and attracting investors (such as [[GPT-based appliance manuals]] or [[GPT-based AB testing]])
	- and my big life idea: [[The Open Market]]
		- _after discussing with [[Miks]] I am now convinced I need to build this one._
		- _but_ it requires to find concrete hypothesis that can be tested and validated (and here validated means: generate revenue —or some metric that, in the context of what we build, is announcing revenue)
			- [[How to be a Founder]]
			- [[The Mom Test]]
		- And it requires me to find and convince someone from [[EF W23 PA CORE]] to build it with me (and ideally, a CTO.)
- Trying to rework my [[Open Market random notes (WIP)]] and writings into [[Evergreen notes]]
	- I previously aimed to write blogs (such as https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/open-market-series/)
		- But blogging requires finished thoughts
	- Notes, especially [[Evergreen notes]], seem to be much more adapted here
- I wrote [[The Open Market manifesto]] —Now about to share it!
	- I also went the drawing way (inspired by [[The Back of the Napkin]]) and drew a comprehensive vision [from the status quo to the Open Market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RTec72Niv_KrLNu12v-U8Q_a22dbKKJd/view?usp=sharing).
- I'm pretty clear that I want to be CEO. I want to be making the strategic decisions and be the one taking it from a vision to being an actual, concrete company.
	- But I also know that , eventually , I don't aspire to be a CEO. I rather see myself on multiple boards and helping others to start projects.
		- Note to write: [[Why CEO?]]
		- [[Looking 5 years ahead]] [[Looking 10 years ahead]]
