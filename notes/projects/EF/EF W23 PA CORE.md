A bit like daily notes, this running note aims to gather my thoughts and journaling and thinking about the [[EF]] programme I just joined.

- [Reading List](https://entrepreneurfirst.notion.site/Reading-List-e9bc6716ca14473fb280bd8433b7dea2)
- [[EF shortlist]]

## Week 2 ([[2023-week-39]])

- This week I decided I would [[Do something crazy every day]]
	- Allowing myself to dream too big ([[Don't be afraid to dream out loud]])
	- As a consequence, I started reaching out out of my league
- Started the week meeting with [[Edoardo]] and [[Sarah]] on Sunday
	- I'll convince them to come on board with me
	- But first I need to get things started and concrete
- This week my goal was to do deep customer discovery on both ends
	- Consumers
	- Contributors
- And to design an experiment to run on week 3 (the official first week of the programme)
- Learnings are going to be kept private for now (not [[Building in public]] for this part)
- 
- 
- TODO EOW: re-assess decision to stop looking for a co-founder

## Week 1 ([[2023-week-38]])

- Started the week meeting with [[Andi]] (Sunday)
	- We hadn't seen each other in person for 3 years
	- Inspiring and motivating to get started with [[What I want to build at EF]]
	- Discussed in depth [[The Open Market Manifesto]]
		- and [[Open Market random notes (WIP)]]
	- And many other philosophical topics!
- I have the answer to [[Why CEO?]]
	- I might not be looking for a "co-founder" in the end
		- I have a very clear and determined vision
		- I am going to build [[The Biggest Tech Company on Earth]]
			- And patch our Economic System with an Upgrade
				- To fix alienation, capital concentration, and innovation inefficiencies
					- [[Open innovation is the healthiest competition]]
					- a Marxist Startup Studio
			- I am going to free workers, and free intellectual property
				- Building The European Dream
- Published https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/
- I am feeling super happy and free and inspired! All positive so far
- Decided to relax a bit from [[EF]] guidance and methodology
	- In the end, my situation might be different enough that it deserves exceptions
	- I will stop my co-founder search for now
		- And start building
			- I will re-assess this decision end of next week

## Week 0 ([[2023-week-37]])

- I've been thinking a lot about [[What I want to build at EF]]
	- There's a lot of unknowns and it's making me nervous
		- I think I have something like [[FIAMO]]
	- I'm torn between ideas that I can see making short-term profits and attracting investors (such as [[GPT-based appliance manuals]] or [[GPT-based AB testing]])
	- and my big life idea: [[The Open Market]]
		- _after discussing with [[Miks]] I am now convinced I need to build this one._
		- _but_ it requires to find concrete hypothesis that can be tested and validated (and here validated means: generate revenue —or some metric that, in the context of what we build, is announcing revenue)
			- [[How to be a Founder]]
			- [[The Mom Test]]
		- And it requires me to find and convince someone from [[EF W23 PA CORE]] to build it with me (and ideally, a CTO.)
- Trying to rework my [[Open Market random notes (WIP)]] and writings into [[Evergreen notes]]
	- I previously aimed to write blogs (such as https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/open-market-series/)
		- But blogging requires finished thoughts
	- Notes, especially [[Evergreen notes]], seem to be much more adapted here
- I wrote [[The Open Market Manifesto]] —Now about to share it!
	- I also went the drawing way (inspired by [[The Back of the Napkin]]) and drew a comprehensive vision [from the status quo to the Open Market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RTec72Niv_KrLNu12v-U8Q_a22dbKKJd/view?usp=sharing).
- I'm pretty clear that I want to be CEO. I want to be making the strategic decisions and be the one taking it from a vision to being an actual, concrete company.
	- But I also know that , eventually , I don't aspire to be a CEO. I rather see myself on multiple boards and helping others to start projects.
		- Note to write: [[Why CEO?]]
		- [[Looking 5 years ahead]] [[Looking 10 years ahead]]
