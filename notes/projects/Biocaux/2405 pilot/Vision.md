- producers register with the platform and have a way to input available products some time in advance. we offer pricing options and advice. initially, we will go to them directly and work with them to make it easier and get better prices.
- users register with the platform and set their profile: available equipment, fitness goals (cal per day (link to another app/tool to compute this? or how?), bulking/maintaining/loosing weight as a slider), eating preferences and allergies/ingredients to avoid, some opt-in information about them that would allow us to cluster user and make smart recommendations later on (TBD, could be favorite meals and completely different stuff about them that turns out to be useful discriminants when clustering food preferences), we might ask them to upvote/downvote a few random recipes in order to build their taste profile for example (later on we might provide better options for individual profiles and group making), the time that they have available to cook, number of meals per day, their budget per portion.
- then we would gather main fresh ingredients available around the user (50km range) + some ingredients should be globally available (or available from a storage/partner facility, such as a Satoriz shop). for that, we require the user to input delivery options (location and date).
- the user is then able to access the shopping area. exploring producers, ingredients ; recipes and food advice ; their basket and profile editing.
- the user should then be able to use the "meal planner" specifying a number of meals x portions for the next x (range from +5 (for ability to plan/get to producers) to +12 (for freshness)) days. we should recommend them to do bulk cooking especially for meals that won't get eaten in the first 3 days (for freshness and practical reasons). the range is also based on selected delivery options.
- the meal planner would output a ordered scrollable list of recipes matching their profile (some things are binary yes/no, some others are flexible preferences) and based on available/privileged ingredients. we ask users to pick from them (as many as they selected meals) with a note that they will be able to personalize at the next step (such as editing the number of portions separately, swapping ingredients, going back and adding/removing recipes). users might have favorite recipes that could appear at the top / in a separate/collapsible section of the list. the recipe price per portion is displayed as well as the sum for the selected default portions number ("from x€/portion (X€ for 2)") 
- the user should be able to go back and forth without losing their personalizations for the already-selected recipes. but they should be able to go back to add more meals or change their minds and select different recipes. when editing the price should be updated accordingly.
- on confirmation, we will prompt the user the list of ingredients, matching them automatically with the best supplier option (distance/price/based on previous reviews (fav vs avoid)) . we would clearly display ingredients that are needed but not provided . users should be able to leave out/add back ingredients , for example if they already have it at home or not. the price of the packaging is displayed. it is paid but it's only "held". we should clearly mark it as such. we may offer some users (eg, subscribed ones?) not to pay this price.
- users should be able to edit the default selected supplier and manually select another one.
- they should be able to edit delivery options within possible values (location, dates).
- once payment is confirmed, the producers would get the request and prepare the packages accordingly (precutting, in clean jars, emptying air out, etc.). 
- as per our supply chain, the driver would collect from the producer and then to the user. we might require some cold storage for local centralization matters.
- the user would get delivered within the selected timeframe at their home. the driver should collect old jars. we ask users to rince (must)/preferably clean them beforehand.
- the driver would deposit the jar in a collection center for cleaning and reuse.
- the user would then have a dedicated space to rate producers/suppliers as well as recipes.
- users should be able to provide freeform feedback at any time during the process.
