**Here, we are redesigning the web for communities.** We are extending and combining open standards and open-source components to build the best end-to-end social application.

[[Smash Developers Wiki]]

How do we define 'the best' social application?

Our founding principles are:

- **Safety**: good societies are safe spaces where you—and everyone—can feel protected,
- **Quality**: curation is the digital gold, it belongs to all of us and shouldn't be comprised,
- **Privacy**: each one of us should be able to fully own and control their own data,
- **Freedom**: individual liberation and freedom come first, not leaving room for monopolies,
- **Inclusivity**: we all are strangers to someone, always seek to understand,

What do we mean by 'end-to-end'?

Smash is just a client. You own your data and you can communicate with your contacts peer to peer, without any intermediary. Smash defines multiple components that, together, enable social use cases online.

You can join neighborhoods. Like in the real world, digital neighborhoods are where individuals meet and can form communities online. Neighborhoods, as entities, do play the role of an intermediary when it comes to verifying, connecting, and curating people and content, but once you are connected all communications can happen directly.

Smash is a 1:N messaging and a curated content sharing app. As part of its architecture, we are designing The DSNSP (a temporary name for our Decentralized Social Networking Standard Protocols). The DSNSP is a standard combining open solutions and APIs to run a free digital social world. Each function is standardized separately and ran in isolation as micro services. As we promote full openness and interoperability, this means that Smash's DSNSP could be used for many other applications and use cases. Effectively redesigning the web for digital communities.

Because the protocols we are building are open and modular, you can switch and join as many neighborhoods as you'd like. You can also build your own client; or you can expand Smash.

For the same reasons it also means that, as in real life, there will be good and bad neighborhoods.
We are no one to judge. Be careful out there and be kind to one another. Share recommendations!

As the pioneers of this new internet, we will kickstart a few neighborhoods.

Our very first one is the Smash Developers neighborhood. To join, you must contribute to the Smash Chats app or one of the co-developed protocols and apply for a (free) membership.

- To contribute, browse our Git repositories and especially issues tagged 'beginners'.
- As a Smash Developer (or not), you can apply for bounties on issues tagged 'bounties'.
- To become a Smash Developer, you can apply for the (free) membership here!

Smash Developers have access to all code repositories, internal discourse, and neighborhood.

If you are not interested in becoming a Smash Developer, but are interested in joining early Smash Chats neighborhoods, please complete our survey to join the waitlist.

See you online!
