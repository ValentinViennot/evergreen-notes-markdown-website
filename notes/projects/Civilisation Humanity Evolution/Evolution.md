[[TODO]]

Expanding [[Humanity]].

Project to replicate and expand human extra-terrestrial communities into space.

Keep them connected via [[Web3.1]] , 
	Same as it used to take days to send messages from one city to another.
	It will take days to send data from one galaxy to another.
	But we will adapt.
	We will find resources and knowledge elsewhere.
	And all Humanity across the Universe will benefit from it.
