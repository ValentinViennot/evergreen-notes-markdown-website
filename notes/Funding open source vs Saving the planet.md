# Common tragedies: Funding open source vs Saving the planet

In [Why open source isn't profitable](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/), I explain the 'Curse of Competition' as a sort of [[Tragedy of the Commons]]: Because open source intellectual property is free to access, all economic agents will exploit it without giving back (known as the 'free riders' issue).

With the same analysis, we can explain how and why our current dominant economic system will eventually consume all of the available natural resources and destroy all living species. That is, unless proper regulations were to be globally adopted. (**TODO: read and link Eleonor's work**)

## Two very different tragedies of the commons

To some extent, open source isn't exactly a typical [[Tragedy of the Commons]]. In the case of open source, the present resource isn't scarce. Once intellectual property or knowledge has been produced, its reproduction cost is null. Therefore creating an abundance of the said open resource. There ends the analogy with Nature.

Indeed, the key issue with growth economic models is that they rely on the abundance of a resource, which most often isn't the case. Especially when it comes to natural resources. **TODO: link to natural limits being exhausted**

## Instant value

The value of open source comes both from its past and its future, not its present state. Before, when the value is being created. And after, when the said resource's value might decrease of even go negative in case sufficient maintenance isn't provided (bugs, CVEs, malware etc).

These are the two types of value that open source creates,

1. **Positive value**: delivering an innovative solution to an outstanding problem,
2. **Negative value**: requiring maintenance work in order to remain valuable.

Both types are ''**instant value**'' —comparable to Power in an Electricity market.

### Open source factories

Imagine if open source projects were knowledge factories and open source contributors were machines in these factories. Without power, these factories are worth nothing. With power, with electricity, the machines can start functioning and delivering potential value.

Take two of these factories. Depending on the number of machines and their type, the instant power of the two factories might differ. One might require 10kW and the other 5kW to function. Let's assume we budget 10kWh for each. The first factory will be able to function for an hour and the second for two hours.

After an hour, which of the two factories did deliver more value?
With a budget of 10kWh, which of the two factories did deliver more value?

Well, we don't know. In fact, it wouldn't matter if one absorbed 100kWh and the other 10Wh. The only thing that matters is their outcome and its value to society (or rather, to the market).

It probably requires as much energy to build an iPhone 15 than a Nokia 3560 (**TODO: update with real models and if possible a study**). However, one has double the value of the other on the market.

In fact, that's exactly how value is being defined in the current economy.

Energy has a production cost and therefore is virtually limited. The selling price of the produced goods and services must be higher than its production cost, otherwise it wouldn't create value and the company would quickly crash on the market and possibly go bankrupt.

> It's important to note that companies have 'innovation inertia'. They will often likely crash on the markets before going bankrupt. This will give them a last chance to innovate and turn the ship around.

The current economy is designed to maximise the `price-cost=value` equation.

In theory, this design should maximise the innovative value delivered by companies.

In practice, monopolies grew and tech companies now spend more energy fighting than innovating. In fact, there's a significant decrease in productivity directly attributable to them. **TODO: Link to GNU manifesto and economic studies.**

## The open source tragedy

**The tragedy of open source is that it's a fantastic factory without electricity.**

Open source has no business model. It's not able to create added value as defined by our current economy and therefore not able to power itself. In other words: there's no investment loop (= [open source is not profitable](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/)).

What is scarce is not open source knowledge itself, as the created knowledge is abundant. What is scarce is the instant value of open source: the power of contributors. The maintainers. _They_ are the tragically endangered _Commons_. What if they stopped working and delivering? **TODO: link to maintainers, linux, npm etc**

Despite open source being **the best knowledge-innovation factory** at our disposal, very few are willing to power it. In fact, why should anyone pay for electricity if everyone else is going to benefit from the produced knowledge as well? There it is: the same tragic destiny that Mother Earth is facing.

And it gets worse ; if some people are willing to work for free, why should we even pay them?
I often heard that '_maybe_ they don't _want_ to get paid, _maybe_ paying them will _change_ them.'

-Breathe.-

**The economy should be here to serve humanity, not the opposite.**

If the current state of our economy is slowing down innovation, then our economy is broken.

## Markets as a tool in our belt

Financial markets are a powerful tool to incentivise value creation and the unstoppable race to innovation. We successfully used them to drive many years of incredible technological progress. **TODO: link to techno-capital manifesto**

**Unfortunately, the current version of our financial markets might well destroy humanity.**

Unless we successfully create incentives to invest back into the 'Commons'.

### Curation markets: New economies

About seven years go, @simondlr started writing about [Curation Markets](https://medium.com/@simondlr/introducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881). A new kind of financial instrument that would be able to create incentives to [Save the Planet](https://medium.com/@simondlr/saving-the-planet-making-it-profitable-to-protect-the-commons-50393906fe22).

The principle is simple: tokenising a scarce resource and using a mathematical formula to incentivise more new investments. This results in a financial market with clear rules, ability to make a profit & influence the game, and potential value creation.

[DeSo](https://docs.deso.org/) adopted this principle to tokenise influencers' popularity on social networks and allow them to leverage it to fund their content and the future of their 'Brand'.

The outcome is New Economies: Creator Economy, Gig Economy, Curation Economy, etc.

> Note that new economies are just tools as well. They aren't inherently good or bad (in fact, nothing is **TODO: link shakespeare**). However, arguably, the uncertainty of gigs and creators  revenues (vs waged work) is a problem. This is something that could be solved through regulations, such as implementing a Universal Base Income. Worker collectives, or cooperatives, could also arise and solve this problem with an 'insurance' risk-smoothing model.

Creating new economies is hard, especially within the current global economy. The new economy must first validate two key hypotheses: value creation and growth. In addition, economies are subject to network effects and require 'fuel' (= money) to power them. 

This isn't much different to creating a new venture. In fact, Uber, AirBnB and many others are platform-type ventures that successfully created new economies. It's just much harder.

## Investing in open source's future

The same thing can be done with open source: Incentivising investors and consumers to pay for the electricity that powers the open source factories.

### Value creation hypothesis

In fact, some corporations and public entities are already paying to maintain and develop specific, popular open-source projects. They are subsidising their instant value creation. And the most successful open-source projects even are able to sell extra services on top.

This is the value creation hypothesis: **the instant value delivered by open-source projects is valuable to other economic agents with strong economic motives to subsidise it.**

It might be new projects that will give them a competitive market edge over their proprietary competitors or maintaining older projects that they use or will use as critical dependencies.

In an EU commission report, the Franhofer institute concluded that for each 1€ injected in subsidising open source, close to 800€ were created in the global European economy (GDP). **TODO**

The instant value is a 'Common' ; but, together, the economic agents realise that they might financially benefit from subsidising it successfully.

### Growth hypothesis

Wait, but why aren't big corporations forking free projects and maintaining their own versions? Because the sum is greater than its parts. Forking Ubuntu sure gives you a fully-working Linux Distribution... but it's not "Ubuntu" anymore. It isn't able to attract future contributions.

The value created by open-source projects is in their name. Not their Intellectual Property (it belongs to their authors), nor their License (it's free to use for everyone), nor their usage (it's by-design commoditised, anyone can run it at-cost). The value of an open-source project vs another is its brand: **its ability to attract more users, contributors, and potential investments**.

The 'brand' of an open-source project, its identity, is the result of many intangibles: the governance of the project, its roadmap and prioritisation decisions, the quality of its contributions, the names of its contributors, its documentation, its vision and ideology, etc.

It doesn't matter whether the project's contributions are getting paid or not. In fact, 80% of the contributions to Linux are being made by waged developers working for big corporations. Hell, in 1999, IBM even granted 1B$ to the Linux project trying to disrupt their evil child (=Microsoft). It was the first time that a big corporation used open source to successfully disrupt a market. **TODO**

This is the growth hypothesis: **the more a project brand is able to attract contributions, the more valuable it gets and the more it will be able to attract future contributions.**

A corollary is that the more projects are being open-sourced, the more will be.

### From over-the-counter transactions to a market

As I wrote, over-the-counter transactions are already happening and some economic agents are already subsidising open-source projects' instant value creation and economic future.

It mostly happens through 'Fondations' like the Linux Fondation and the Cloud Native Computing Fondation. In my opinion, the investment motivation for Big Tech to participate in these Fondations is obvious: they want to maintain their monopolies and their control over innovation. **TODO: support what I'm saying here with credible sources?**

Open source is a powerful disruption tool to control markets. If you have enough capital, you can fund open-source alternatives to your competitors and maintain your domination. The open-sourcing of generative AI models is an interesting data point to support this analysis.

Overall, a generic rule appears: **economic agents are willing to subsidise open source if they can gain a strategic benefit out of it and if they are not the only ones to be paying for it.**

This is a similar hypothesis to the one of the crowdfunding approach.

An interesting side effect of crowdfunding is that it creates a marketplace: with the last transaction setting the price for something that would otherwise be too abstract to valuate.

As an open source contributor, you would now be able to directly compare your funding to other similar projects and to level your instant value pricing. By default, one Watt is the same as another Watt, what may make it more or less valuable is the perspective of what will get built.

## The Open Market: a crowdfunded FLOSS venture capital

For years I had in mind the principles of an 'Open Market', a platform that would systematically give market value to open-source innovation. Contributors would get fairly rewarded for the instant value they delivered, projects would be able to attract funding and contributions, consumers would be able to influence the future of their favorite projects, and investors would be able to bet on the future of innovation.

This is the logical conclusion to what I wrote above: **a platform to fund open source**.

For it to be successful, the incentives must be aligned. There must be a clear and shared definition of 'value', allowing for a profit motive. As discussed, with open source projects, this is what the 'brand' represents. It's the ability of a project to attract future contributions. That's what the yet-not-materialised open source market values.

If you are raising funding for your open source project and you need 100kWh to make it happen, the value of the required energy will depend on the perspective of what you want to build.

`Money(t) = Brand(t) / Time(t)`

_With Money the funding raised, Brand the perceived project's value, and Time the work (energy) required to make it happen. —see another representation in [Why open source?](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/why-open-source/#the-new-open-economy)_

### Turning open source brands into commodities

What if you could reward contributors with a share of what they built ; i.e. pay Linux maintainers with a share of 'Linux'. Together, they would own the name of the brand that they created.

Previously over-the-counter transactions would now happen through this open source brands market. The price of the last transaction would represent the market value of the said brand.

The more a project is able to attract new contributions, especially paid contributions, the higher its market value. Of course, speculators would also want to enter the game. They would start betting on which project will be able to attract the most transactions _in the future_. Doing so, they will create liquidity for contributors to cash out at a market price.

Some projects will crash. Especially if they make strategic decisions that are non-beneficial to their paying investor-customers. Then, their perceived ability to attract future contributions will go down and so will their market value. Some investor-contributors might make a loss. Likely, a fork project would then better listen to the market and start attracting new contributions.

Some projects will never attract paid contributions. They will have a market cap of zero and their contributors would work for free, paid with shares of a vision or an ideology.

What I'm describing here is very close to the stock-equity market and the entrepreneurship, venture capital world. In fact, that's exactly what it is ; but making two fundamentally different axioms: intellectual property must be free and the work of contributors must be free.

**It's a FLOSS* venture capital market.** (\*Free and Libre Open Source Software)

This probably won't help funding your random open-source app, but this will open profitable perspectives of market success despite being open source (or, because of being open source).

In fact, entering this market while not being open source would represent a high risk —same as a company becoming public without publishing their financial results. We might decide to make it illegal to do so, but even if it wasn't the risk would probably be too big for investors anyway.

(I am right now working on building this financial market designed for open source. If you'd like to work with me, please do reach out! **TODO**)

## So, can we save the planet?

A similar Curation Market could be envisioned to value natural resources, thus reversing the tragedy of the commons, and saving the planet (read @simondlr's vision). **TODO: link**

On paper, it's beautiful. But it likely won't happen. At least, not without global regulations.

### Nature vs Open source

Open source contributors have immense leverage: what if they stopped working?

That's the same leverage that employees have over employers to increase their salaries. What if they stopped working? They could unionise and go on strike, or they could just go. The offer meets the demand and create an equilibrium: the markets are playing their desirable role. In fact, this power balance is not only desirable, it's required for markets to function properly.

Open source is everywhere and embedded itself as a critical dependency to almost every businesses today ; even if they haven't yet acknowledged it. As [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital/) rightly puts it on their website, "Open Source is eating software itself faster than software is eating the world."

However, Nature can't go on strike.

While open source won't exist if we don't power it, Nature doesn't have this leverage. Natural resources are easy to abuse —and often won't complain. That's why regulations are needed. We —as citizens— need to go on strike in the name of Nature. We need to lobby for it. We must unionise natural resources and make them expensive to use as our most precious good.

### A word on nature going on strike

I take back what I wrote before: Nature can and will go on strike. In fact, it has already started demonstrations —it's show time. As we abused our natural resources for too long, bad consequences are starting to happen. Sadly, when this happens it's often too late.

Of course it isn't intentional. That's systemic consequences to our systemic actions.

We, as humans, must fix our system before it's too late for good. We want to survive.

## Consequences: de-growth and a new economy

De-growth is inevitable in order to avoid the tragic fate of the 'Commons'.

We must regulate and decrease our use of resources. We must learn to co-exist with other species without destroying their environment and tampering their living conditions.

We must buy less, consume less, want less, do less, travel less...

Unfortunately, the design of our currently dominant economic system requires growth. When less money is being spent in the economy, painful crisis happen. Ironically, crisis lead to less spendings and truly unfortunate consequences.

Crisis are never a good time or condition to save ~~the planet~~ humanity.

Assuming we won't change our global economy in time, we need to find a hack.

### Technological growth vs Production growth

Observing the _status quo_, we can split growth in two distinct categories:

1. **Technological growth**: also known as 'progress', or expanding knowledge,
2. **Production growth**: technically the current economic growth, aka 'more goods'.

The latter is the root cause. Producing always more goods and services require always more energy and natural resources, which leads us to sell our souls and destroy our celestial home.

In a world with finite resources, infinite growth isn't credible. Abundance is theoretical.

In fact, the problem with our current economy is that the two types of growth are intertwined.

If we could have technological growth without production growth, we would be fine.
(In that case, it would maybe even be possible that technology might indeed save us.) **TODO: link article on technology that won't save us**

But for technological growth to happen, we must sell always more goods and services in order to create marginal value and extract capital that will then, in part, fund the next technologies.

When you add to that the current innovation inefficiencies coming from monopolies, unhappy alienated workers, arbitrary development, capital-markets inertia, ... our chances that technology will be in time to save us are pretty low.

### Open innovation economy

With the proposed Open Market, we are splitting the 'innovation' economy from the traditional 'production' economy. We are powering a much more efficient, need-driven, open-innovation economic machine.

Knowledge will expand without the need to sell always more goods and services.
As knowledge will now be free, it'll be abundant. Everyone will exploit it to their needs.

As a consequence, traditional businesses will be able to offer at-cost, cheap goods and services. Their incentive won't anymore be to produce always more, rather to produce 'better'.

In order to be more profitable than their competitors, businesses will need to deliver their goods and services while lowering their production costs. Meaning: decreasing their use of resources.

Creative, un-commoditised, differentiated work will be highly valued. For example: arts, politics, personalised services will still be relevant and even more highly valued by consumers.

In this new macro economy ; Successful businesses would: 

1. Exploit free knowledge to deliver commoditised goods and services,
2. Optimise their use of natural resources in order to increase their profit margins,
3. Increase the amount of differentiated labour to deliver highly-personalised solutions,
4. Selfishly invest back some of their profits into open innovation in order to create more value.

Consumers would:

1. Access goods and services at a fair, cheap price,
2. Consume less as business incentives now are to produce better,
3. Access higher-quality goods and services based on open innovation,
4. Spend part of their budget directly on crowdfunding desirable innovation.

Open source contributors would:

1. Work freely on projects they value, responding to market incentives,
2. Sell or trade their earned shares in order to diversify and cash out when needed,
3. (Maybe: form cooperatives to ensure more stable and sustainable revenue streams.)

Investors would:

1. Buy and hold shares of projects they think will increase in value with time (= take risks),
2. Spend money on making their project-investments more attractive, funding development.

## Isn't AI going to destroy humanity anyway?

Maybe. It's up to us. **TODO: link to inhumane AI***

Once more, Artificial Intelligence is just a tool. Nothing is either good or bad.

AI-powered systems are starting to generate undifferentiated, [[Creative Labour]]. Yet, their nature makes them likely to quickly get commoditised (the use of the AI models , not their output).

It might mean that many so-far-human-only arts and crafts will eventually get disrupted by AI and that AIs will eventually compete with humans and make our labour less valuable.

If we don't make clear conscious human decisions today, choosing an AI over a human for [[Creative Labour]]-type of works **will** happen for cost motives. Additionally, their output might very soon become at least as good, if not better, than those of above-average humans.

At this point, I believe that we need to remember **Why we work**. Beyond the economic system and the profit motives, humans work to give [meaning to their lives](https://mindthegapblog.com/posts/we-all-have-a-mission/) and consciously, intentionally shape their world. We work _because_ we are humans.

AI will have the ability to do that for us.

The question is not whether they will be capable of doing it.
The question is how do we -as humans- want that to happen.

And we can't let our economic system choose for us ; we know the outcome.

We need conscious human decisions now.

**Human constructs, Technology and Economy, are here to serve humans. Not the opposite.**
